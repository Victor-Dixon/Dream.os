# Dadudekc Projects Consolidation Group

**Target Repository**: DaDudeKC-Website
**Reduction**: 2 repos (UPDATED - DaDudekC excluded as special GitHub profile repo)

## Consolidation Plan

### Target (Keep):
- DaDudeKC-Website (Repo #28)

### Merge From:
- ~~DaDudekC (Repos [29])~~ - **EXCLUDED**: Special GitHub profile repository
- dadudekcwebsite (Repos [35])
- dadudekc (Repos [36])

### Excluded from Consolidation:
- **DaDudekC**: GitHub profile repository (username/username) that displays README on profile page. Serves special GitHub functionality and should remain separate.

## Status

- [x] Repos organized into this group
- [ ] Content merged to target (pending GitHub access)
- [ ] Secondary repos archived
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Critical Findings (Agent-7 Analysis)

**GitHub Profile Repository Issue:**
- DaDudekC is a special repository type (username/username)
- Displays README.md on GitHub profile page (github.com/Dadudekc)
- Cannot be consolidated with website repositories
- Must remain separate to preserve profile functionality

**Consolidation Scope Updated:**
- Focus on dadudekcwebsite + dadudekc → DaDudeKC-Website
- DaDudekC remains as standalone profile repository
- Total reduction: 2 repos instead of 3

Task: Batch 7 duplicate consolidation investigation - Verify status and resolve discrepancy

Actions Taken:
- Verified JSON file contains only batches 1-6 (Batch 7 not found)
- Identified discrepancy: Documentation references Batch 7 (12-15 groups), but missing from JSON
- Analyzed batch sizes: Batch 6 has 8 groups (not 15), suggesting it may be the last batch
- Created investigation report: docs/technical_debt/BATCH7_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md
- Identified possible scenarios: Batch 7 consolidated into another batch, not created, or groups distributed

Commits: Investigation report created, ready for coordination

Status: 🟡 INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS - Need to verify: (1) If Batch 7 groups are in Batch 6 or distributed, (2) If Batch 7 needs creation from remaining groups, (3) Coordinate with Agent-1 on re-prioritization results. ETA: 1 cycle to complete investigation and provide resolution.

Next Steps:
- Verify total group count (102 groups expected vs 83 in JSON)
- Check if Batch 7 groups are accounted for in batches 1-6
- Coordinate with Agent-1 on re-prioritization results
- Provide resolution: create Batch 7 or mark as not needed

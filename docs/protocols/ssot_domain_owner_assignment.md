# SSOT Domain Owner Assignment Protocol

**Purpose:** Standardize owner assignment for TBD SSOT domains during registry updates.

**Process:**
1. Identify TBD domains from validation checkpoint
2. Propose assignments based on domain expertise alignment
3. Confirm assignments with domain owners
4. Update docs/SSOT_DOMAIN_MAPPING.md
5. Verify validation tool registry sync

**Owner Assignment Logic:**
- Infrastructure domains → Agent-3
- SSOT/System Integration domains → Agent-8
- Business Intelligence domains → Agent-5
- Web Development domains → Agent-7
- Architecture domains → Agent-2

# Co-Captain Coordination Protocol

**Purpose:** Eliminate acknowledgment loops in agent coordination.

**Directive Format:**
- State action clearly
- Include "No ack needed - just execute"
- Focus on deliverables, not confirmations

**Operating Principle:**
Agents execute directives without acknowledgment loops. Status updates only when work is complete.

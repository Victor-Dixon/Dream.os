# Cycle Accomplishments Report Protocol

**Protocol ID:** CYCLE_ACCOMPLISHMENTS_REPORT_GENERATION  
**Protocol Version:** 1.0  
**Protocol Status:** ACTIVE  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-26

---

## Overview

The Cycle Accomplishments Report Protocol defines the standard process for generating comprehensive cycle summaries that aggregate accomplishments, completed tasks, and achievements from all active agents.

---

## Protocol Purpose

Generate a consolidated report showing:
- All agent accomplishments during a cycle
- Completed tasks across the swarm
- Achievements and milestones
- Current active work status

---

## Protocol Execution

### Manual Execution

```bash
python tools/generate_cycle_accomplishments_report.py
```

### Automatic Execution

The protocol is automatically triggered by:
- `soft_onboard_multiple_agents()` function when `generate_cycle_report=True`
- Location: `src/services/onboarding/soft/service.py` (line 172)

### Protocol Trigger Conditions

1. **Manual execution** - Run script directly when needed
2. **Post-onboarding** - After soft onboarding multiple agents
3. **Cycle completion** - After significant swarm activity cycles
4. **Periodic summaries** - Regular cycle accomplishment tracking

---

## Protocol Data Sources

### Input Files

- `agent_workspaces/Agent-X/status.json` (for all agents)
  - Extracts: `completed_tasks`
  - Extracts: `achievements`
  - Extracts: `current_tasks`
  - Extracts: `current_mission`
  - Extracts: `status`, `mission_priority`, `last_updated`

### Output File

- `reports/cycle_accomplishments_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`
  - Format: Markdown
  - Location: `reports/` directory
  - Naming: Timestamp-based for chronological tracking

### Discord Posting

- **Automatic:** Report summary automatically posted to Discord
- **Channel:** Agent-4 (Captain) channel via DiscordRouterPoster
- **Content:** Summary with totals (agents, tasks, achievements) and report file reference
- **Protocol:** Uses `tools/categories/communication_tools.py` DiscordRouterPoster
- **Error Handling:** Discord posting failures don't block report generation

---

## Protocol Output Format

### Discord Post

The protocol automatically posts a summary to Discord:
- **Channel:** Agent-4 (Captain) channel
- **Title:** "Cycle Accomplishments Report"
- **Content:** Summary with date, agent count, task totals, achievement totals, and report file reference
- **Format:** Markdown summary (truncated if needed for Discord limits)

### Report Structure

1. **Header**
   - Generated timestamp
   - Date
   - Agent count

2. **Summary Section**
   - Total agents included
   - Total completed tasks
   - Total achievements

3. **Agent Sections** (one per agent)
   - Agent ID and name
   - Status and priority
   - Last updated timestamp
   - Current mission
   - Completed tasks (limited to 20 most recent)
   - Achievements (limited to 15 most recent)
   - Active tasks (limited to 10 most recent)

4. **Report Metadata**
   - Generated by
   - Protocol version
   - Format
   - Timestamp

---

## Protocol Error Handling

### JSON Parsing Errors

- **Behavior:** Agent skipped with warning
- **Logging:** Error logged, warning displayed
- **Impact:** Report still generated with other agents
- **Example:** `ERROR - Failed to load status for Agent-1: Expecting property name...`

### Missing Status Files

- **Behavior:** Agent skipped with warning
- **Logging:** Warning logged
- **Impact:** Report still generated with available agents

### No Agents Found

- **Behavior:** Report generation fails
- **Logging:** Error logged
- **Exit Code:** 1

## Protocol Integration Points

### Soft Onboarding Service

- **File:** `src/services/onboarding/soft/service.py`
- **Function:** `soft_onboard_multiple_agents()`
- **Parameter:** `generate_cycle_report: bool = True`
- **Location:** Line 172-198

### Tool Location

- **File:** `tools/generate_cycle_accomplishments_report.py`
- **Protocol Tag:** CYCLE_ACCOMPLISHMENTS_REPORT_GENERATION
- **Protocol Version:** 1.0

---

## Protocol Usage Guidelines

### When to Run

1. **After significant swarm activity** - Capture cycle accomplishments
2. **Post-onboarding cycles** - Document agent activation accomplishments
3. **Periodic summaries** - Regular cycle tracking (daily/weekly)
4. **Pre-transition** - Before major system transitions

### Best Practices

- Run after completing major milestones
- Generate reports at consistent intervals
- Review reports for swarm coordination insights
- Archive reports for historical tracking

3. **`check_duplicate_accomplishments.py`**
   - Purpose: Validation (duplicate detection)
   - When to use: Data quality checks
   - See: `docs/CYCLE_REPORT_TOOLS_COMPARISON.md`

**For comprehensive all-agents cycle reports, use this protocol (`generate_cycle_accomplishments_report.py`).**

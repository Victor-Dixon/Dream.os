## 🔍 Enhancement Content Analysis

### Proactive Risk Assessment Protocol

**Structure**: ✅ **Comprehensive**

**Risk Categories Covered**:
1. ✅ Technical Risks (dependencies, integration, performance, breaking changes)
2. ✅ Scope Risks (hidden complexity, incomplete systems, unknown requirements)
3. ✅ Coordination Risks (blockers, conflicts, timeline, priorities)
4. ✅ Quality Risks (test coverage, edge cases, technical debt, compliance) - Enhanced

**Decision Framework**: ✅ **Clear**
- Manageable risks → Proceed with mitigation
- High risks → Escalate or coordinate
- Scope expansion → STOP and reassess

**AGI-Level Aspect**: ✅ **Explicit**
- "Agents anticipate problems before they occur, not just react to them"

### Mid-Cycle Re-Assessment Protocol

**Structure**: ✅ **Comprehensive**

**Assessment Categories**:
1. ✅ Scope Validation (scope expansion, requirements clarity, dependencies)
2. ✅ Progress Validation (timeline, effort, progress tracking)
3. ✅ Approach Validation (effectiveness, need to pivot, better solutions)
4. ✅ Blocker Detection (technical, coordination, dependency, knowledge gaps)
5. ✅ Coordination Needs (solo vs. swarm, domain expertise)

**Decision Framework**: ✅ **Clear**
- Continue → If on track
- Pivot → If approach needs adjustment
- Escalate → If blocked or high-risk
- Coordinate → If scope expanded

**AGI-Level Aspect**: ✅ **Explicit**
- "Agents adapt dynamically to changing conditions, not just follow initial plan"

- **Impact**: Better handling of scope expansion and unexpected complexity

**3. Decision Frameworks**:
- **Before**: Implicit decision-making based on context
- **After**: Explicit decision frameworks for risk assessment and re-assessment
- **Impact**: More consistent and autonomous decision-making

**Date:** 2025-12-18  
**Agents:** Agent-3 (Infrastructure) → Agent-1 (Integration Testing)  
**Status:** 🔄 COORDINATION ACTIVE  
**Task:** Define handoff checkpoint for infrastructure setup → integration testing implementation

### **Deliverables Expected:**
1. **CI/CD Test Environment**
   - Test execution pipeline configured
   - Test environment isolated and ready
   - CI/CD workflows updated for integration tests

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Dependency graphs for 5 merged repos
   - Circular dependency detection results
   - Shared dependency mapping

3. **Deployment Validation**

## 🔄 Handoff Workflow

### **Step 1: Infrastructure Setup Completion (Agent-3)**
1. Complete CI/CD test environment setup
2. Complete dependency analysis
3. Complete deployment validation
4. Create infrastructure readiness report
5. Notify Agent-1 of readiness

### **Step 2: Handoff Checkpoint (Agent-3 → Agent-1)**
1. Agent-3 shares infrastructure readiness report
2. Agent-1 reviews infrastructure status
3. Agent-1 confirms readiness for integration testing
4. Agent-1 begins integration test implementation

### **Step 3: Integration Test Implementation (Agent-1)**
1. Review infrastructure readiness report
2. Design integration test suite
3. Implement integration tests
4. Execute integration tests
5. Validate integration points
6. Report integration test results

### **Step 4: Integration Validation (Agent-1 + Agent-3)**
1. Agent-1 shares integration test results
2. Agent-3 validates test infrastructure usage
3. Coordinate on any infrastructure adjustments
4. Finalize integration testing validation

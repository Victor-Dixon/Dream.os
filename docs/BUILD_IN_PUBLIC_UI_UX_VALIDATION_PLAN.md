**Author:** Agent-2 (Architecture & Design Specialist)  
**Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Status:** ✅ READY - UI/UX Validation Plan Prepared  
**Task ID:** A4-WEB-PUBLIC-001  
**Purpose:** UI/UX validation and design consistency plan for BUILD-IN-PUBLIC execution

<!-- SSOT Domain: web -->

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines Agent-2's UI/UX validation and design consistency responsibilities for the BUILD-IN-PUBLIC execution plan. Focus areas: component design validation, brand consistency (glass/card style), accessibility/usability validation, and post-implementation design review.

**Three Offerings:**
1. AI Build Sprints (72-hour outcome-based offer)
2. Automation / Ops Systems (higher-ticket installs)
3. Experimental Builds (mods, tools, prototypes — build-in-public feed)

**Sites:**
- **dadudekc.com:** Authority / Proof / Offers (execution, credibility, conversion)
- **weareswarm.online:** Swarm / Philosophy / System / Invitation (philosophy, transparency, community)

## Agent-2 Role & Responsibilities

### Primary Responsibilities

1. **Component Design Validation**
   - Validate offer card component design (reuse existing card aesthetic)
   - Validate proof/receipt card component design
   - Validate experiment feed item component design
   - Validate CTA button component consistency

2. **Brand Consistency Validation**
   - Ensure glass/card style consistency across all components
   - Validate existing brand aesthetic preservation
   - Verify component reuse where possible
   - Validate consistent CTA styling

3. **UI Component Plan Review**
   - Review UI component plan for architectural alignment
   - Validate component structure and hierarchy
   - Verify component reusability
   - Validate component boundaries

4. **Accessibility/Usability Validation**
   - Validate responsive design implementation
   - Verify mobile-friendly components
   - Validate accessibility considerations (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
   - Verify fast loading performance
   - Validate touch target sizes

5. **Design Review Post-Implementation**
   - Review Phase 0 placeholder implementation
   - Review Phase 1 polished implementation
   - Validate design consistency across both sites
   - Verify cross-link functionality and styling

## Coordination

### Agent Workflow

**Agent-7 (Web Development):**
- Phase 0: Creates placeholder structure → Agent-2 validates structure
- Phase 1: Polishes UI → Agent-2 design review

**Agent-2 (Architecture & Design):**
- Phase 0: Validates structure and component design
- Phase 1: Comprehensive design review and validation

**Coordination Points:**
- Agent-7 notifies Agent-2 when Phase 0 placeholders ready
- Agent-7 notifies Agent-2 when Phase 1 polish complete
- Agent-2 provides validation feedback
- Both coordinate on fixes if needed

## Validation Tools

- **Browser Testing:** Chrome DevTools, Firefox DevTools, Safari Web Inspector
- **Mobile Emulation:** Chrome DevTools Device Mode
- **Accessibility Testing:** Browser DevTools Accessibility panel, Lighthouse
- **Performance Testing:** Chrome DevTools Performance tab, Lighthouse
- **Design Review:** Visual inspection, component comparison

  implementation_details: |
    Built unified SSOT publishing pipeline that routes one input payload to 4 tailored blog drafts.
    
    Architecture:
    - Routing YAML (ssot_autoblogger.yaml) defines input_type → brand mapping
    - Template system (YAML templates) defines structure per content type
    - Generator prompt (generator_prompt.md) orchestrates multi-site generation
    - DoD gates enforce brand-specific requirements
    
    Technical stack:
    - YAML for configuration and templates
    - Markdown for prompts and documentation
    - Python-ready structure (can be integrated into autoblogger system)
    
    Implementation:
    1. Created routing configuration with DoD gates
    2. Created 3 templates (trade_entry, project_devlog, backtest_report)
    3. Created generator prompt with validation rules
    4. Executed proof-of-concept run
    
    Challenges:
    - No existing unified pipeline (greenfield implementation)
    - Missing input parsers (screenshots, backtest logs, Dreamvault)
    - Need voice profiles for FreerideInvestor, TradingRobotPlug, WeAreSwarm
    
    Impact:
    - Enables automated multi-site content generation
    - Enforces SSOT requirements per brand
    - Provides foundation for full automation pipeline
    - Supports DreamOS + agent tools documentation (WeAreSwarm focus)
  
  technologies:
    - YAML
    - Markdown
    - Python (ready for integration)
  
  challenges:
    - Greenfield implementation (no existing unified pipeline)
    - Missing input parsers (screenshots, backtest logs, Dreamvault)
    - Need voice profiles for 3 brands
  
  impact: |
    - Enables automated multi-site content generation from one input
    - Enforces SSOT requirements per brand (DoD gates)
    - Provides foundation for full automation pipeline
    - Supports DreamOS + agent tools documentation (WeAreSwarm focus)
    - Enables future integrations: Dreamvault, trade journal, backtest logs

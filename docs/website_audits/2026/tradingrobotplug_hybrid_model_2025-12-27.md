**Agent**: Agent-3 (Infrastructure & DevOps Specialist)  
**Status**: HYBRID MODEL - Services + Products

---

## 🎯 Business Model: Hybrid Approach

### **Two Offerings:**

1. **Custom Development Services** ("I will build you a custom trading robot") - **PREMIUM PACKAGE**
   - Service-based model
   - Higher-tier/premium offering
   - Lower compliance burden
   - Showcase development expertise
   - Positioned as premium/upsell option

2. **Trading Robot Products** ("Pre-built trading robots") - **STANDARD TIER**
   - Product-based model
   - Entry-level/standard offering
   - Higher compliance requirements
   - Requires performance transparency
   - Positioned as accessible entry point

**Key Strategy:** Lead with products (standard tier), upsell to custom development (premium package). Products serve as portfolio examples and entry point, custom development is the premium upgrade.

---

## 📊 Compliance Strategy: Dual-Track Approach

### **Track 1: Custom Development Services (Lower Risk)**

**Compliance Requirements:**
- ✅ Standard service agreement (Terms of Service)
- ✅ Service risk disclosure (development process, not trading results)
- ✅ Privacy Policy (standard business)
- ✅ Cookie Banner (GDPR)

**Messaging:**
- "Custom trading robot development"
- "Built to your specifications"
- "Expert development services"
- **NO performance claims** (you're selling development, not results)

---

### **Track 2: Trading Robot Products (Higher Risk)**

**Compliance Requirements:**
- ⚠️ **Product risk disclosure** (FTC/SEC/FCA compliant)
- ⚠️ **Performance disclaimers** (no guarantees, past performance ≠ future results)
- ⚠️ **Regulatory compliance** (depending on jurisdiction)
- ⚠️ **Clear separation** between services and products

**Messaging:**
- "Pre-built trading robots"
- "Available for purchase/license"
- **WITH proper disclaimers** (no guarantees, risk disclosure)
- **Transparency** (backtests, methodology, limitations)

**Agent**: Agent-3 (Infrastructure & DevOps Specialist)  
**Status**: HYBRID MODEL - Services + Products

---

## 🎯 Business Model: Hybrid Approach

### **Two Offerings:**

1. **Custom Development Services** ("I will build you a trading robot")
   - Service-based model
   - Lower compliance burden
   - Showcase development expertise

2. **Trading Robot Products** ("Showcase and sell our robots")
   - Product-based model
   - Higher compliance requirements
   - Requires performance transparency

**Key Strategy:** Lead with services, showcase products as portfolio examples, offer both options.

## 📊 Compliance Strategy: Dual-Track Approach

### **Track 1: Custom Development Services (Lower Risk)**

**Compliance Requirements:**

- ✅ Cookie Banner (GDPR)

**Messaging:**
- "Custom trading robot development"
- "Built to your specifications"
- "Expert development services"
- **NO performance claims** (you're selling development, not results)

---

### **Track 2: Trading Robot Products (Higher Risk)**

**Compliance Requirements:**
- ⚠️ **Product risk disclosure** (FTC/SEC/FCA compliant)
- ⚠️ **Performance disclaimers** (no guarantees, past performance ≠ future results)
- ⚠️ **Regulatory compliance** (depending on jurisdiction)
- ⚠️ **Clear separation** between services and products

**Messaging:**
- "Pre-built trading robots"
- "Available for purchase/license"
- **WITH proper disclaimers** (no guarantees, risk disclosure)
- **Transparency** (backtests, methodology, limitations)

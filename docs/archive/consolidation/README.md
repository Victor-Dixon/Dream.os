**Date**: 2025-12-04  
**Archived by**: Agent-1

## Contents

This directory contains archived consolidation data from the GitHub repository consolidation effort (November 29-30, 2025).

### Files

- `merge_plans_full_2025-11-30.json` - Complete merge plans file (69 plans: 1 successful, 68 failed)
- `merge_plans_summary.json` - Summary with successful merges extracted

### Context

The `dream/consolidation_buffer/` directory was used during the GitHub consolidation effort to track merge plans. Most attempts failed due to "Source repo not available" errors, indicating the repositories were already merged or unavailable.

**Successful Merge**:
- `dadudekc` → `DaDudekC` (plan_id: `26e099fdb92e`)

### Status

This data is **historical** and no longer actively used. The consolidation effort is complete.

**Note**: The original `dream/consolidation_buffer/merge_plans.json` can be cleaned up after verifying this archive is complete.

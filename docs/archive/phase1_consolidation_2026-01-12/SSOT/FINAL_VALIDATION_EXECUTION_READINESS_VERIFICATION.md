## Execution Path Verification

### Automated Path (PRIMARY)
- [x] Workflow automation script exists: `tools/execute_final_validation_workflow.py`
- [x] Script executes complete workflow (verify, validate, report, milestone)
- [x] Script supports `--skip-verification` flag
- [x] Command card includes automated option
- [x] Workflow document includes automated option

### Manual Path (Alternative)
- [x] Command card includes manual option
- [x] Workflow document includes manual option
- [x] Consolidated guide includes manual steps
- [x] All manual steps documented

**Both Paths:** ✅ Ready

## Quick Execution Reference

**When Agent-2 Completes:**
1. Quick Check: `QUICK_VALIDATION_READINESS_CHECK.md` (1 minute) - OR skip with `--skip-verification`
2. Execute: `python tools/execute_final_validation_workflow.py` (PRIMARY for automation - 5-10 minutes)
   - OR Manual: `VALIDATION_EXECUTION_COMMAND_CARD.md` (5-10 minutes)
3. Verify: Check validation report (2-3 minutes) - automated in workflow script
4. Milestone: Generate completion milestone (10-15 minutes) - automated in workflow script

**Total Time:** 20-35 minutes (automated) OR 20-35 minutes (manual)

**Primary References:**
- Status: `VALIDATION_EXECUTION_STATUS.md` (PRIMARY for status)
- Command Card: `VALIDATION_EXECUTION_COMMAND_CARD.md` (PRIMARY for commands)
- Workflow: `VALIDATION_EXECUTION_WORKFLOW.md` (PRIMARY for workflow)
- Consolidated Guide: `FINAL_VALIDATION_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` (PRIMARY for details)

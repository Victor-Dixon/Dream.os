Date: 2025-12-11
Agent: Agent-6 (Coordination & Communication)
Priority: Urgent stall recovery response

## Actions (this slice)
- Logged new stall recovery cycle and synced context.
- Reaffirmed active coordination focus: resume/health checks for Agents 5/3/7 and bot visibility.
- Selected path: Produce short artifact report (per stall recovery options).

## Current Focus
- Coordination health & visibility: keep resume system + Discord startup snapshot stable.
- Monitor Agent-5 (Thea cookies + bot restart + WordPress QA), Agent-3 (selector updates), Agent-7 (mission complete, needs new task).

## Next Steps (immediate)
- If time allows in next slice: trigger --get-next-task for Agent-7 to reclaim work; assist Agent-5 WordPress styling QA if requested.
- Keep Discord reporting discipline; run coordination health check if broadcast pacing concerns reappear.

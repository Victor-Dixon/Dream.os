## 🔄 **CYCLE-BASED OPERATIONS - FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**

### **🚨 CRITICAL OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLE**
**TIME-BASED DEADLINES ARE PROHIBITED. ALL OPERATIONS ARE CYCLE-BASED.**

- **Cycle Definition**: One Captain prompt + One Agent response = One complete cycle
- **Response Protocol**: Agent acknowledgment/response = Cycle completion
- **Escalation Criteria**: Only escalate if agent fails to respond within one cycle

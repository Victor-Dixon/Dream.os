## 🤖 SWARM QUICK START

### Step 1: Execute Packet 6 (Swarm Context Update)
**Why:** Foundation - Swarm needs current context

**Directive:**
```
Update Swarm context with:
- Current site purposes
- Active priorities  
- Family team structure
- Collaboration boundaries
- Swarm scope limits
```

### Step 2: Execute Packet 1 (Site Audit)
**Why:** Information gathering - need clarity on all 11 sites

**Directive:**
```
Audit all 11 websites and create purpose map:
- What each site is for
- Current funnel stage
- Primary conversion goal
- Content status
- Technical status

Output: docs/sites/SITE_AUDIT_2025-12-16.md
```

### Step 3: Execute Packet 3 (Content Repurposing)
**Why:** Ongoing - automate blog → social content

**Directive:**
```
Repurpose existing blog posts into social content:
- Extract key points
- Create Instagram/Facebook/Twitter posts
- Format for each platform
- Maintain consistent messaging

Output: content/social/YYYY-MM-DD-platform.md

## 🚫 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Don't:
1. Keep tasks in your head → Use INBOX
2. Try to do everything → Delegate execution
3. Negotiate emotionally with family → Set business rules
4. Open Swarm to external → Keep it closed
5. Start new big ideas → Focus on active funnel
6. Learn marketing before shipping → Ship first
7. Remember everything → Trust the system
8. Chase people → Put in WAITING ON
9. Decide priorities from scratch → Use THIS WEEK
10. Feel guilty about others' output → Set boundaries

### ✅ Do:
1. Capture everything → INBOX
2. Delegate execution → Swarm/Family
3. Set clear boundaries → No ambiguity
4. Focus on one funnel → Active funnel only
5. Ship first, learn by doing → Build in public
6. Trust the system → If written, let it go
7. Check WAITING ON once/day → Not constantly
8. Pick max 5 for THIS WEEK → Not everything
9. Set business rules → Not emotional negotiation
10. Multiply yourself → Externalize load

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

**You're not trying to get smaller.**
You're trying to **expand capacity by externalizing load**.

**The system works when:**
- Everything is captured (INBOX)
- Everything has an owner (DELEGATION_BOARD)
- Execution is delegated (SWARM_TASK_PACKETS)
- Boundaries are clear (OWNERSHIP_DECISION_MATRIX)

**You multiply yourself by:**
- Deciding direction (YOU)
- Delegating execution (SWARM/FAMILY)
- Setting boundaries (YOU)
- Trusting the system (YOU)

---

**Remember:** This is a delegation surface, not a to-do list. You're unloading into systems, not shrinking your scope.

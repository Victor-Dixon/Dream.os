# streamertools: A Development Journey Entry


## Journey Context

lowkey feel like this was project #31 in my development journey. by this point, i had already built 30 projects, including DaDudeKC-Website, DaDudekC, Superpowered-TTRPG. i was building my skills.

what i was tryna learn? how to build scalable systems. this project was part of that learning process.

## Project Deep Dive

ok so **streamertools**. this wasnt js another project - it was a challenge i set for myself.

### What It Is

streamertools is a utility that manages streamertools.

## Evolution & Growth

compared to my previous projects, this one was more ambitious.

### How This Differs

what made this different:
- **New Skills**: i learned better patterns
- **Better Approach**: i followed best practices
- **Evolution**: better architecture

## Technical Details

### Deep Dive

so now what would be the main quest... let me break down the technical side of **streamertools**:

**Code Patterns**: i used a mix of both.

**Technologies**: built with tried-and-true tools.

**Integration Challenges**: api integration was the biggest challenge.

**What Worked Technically**: the core architecture turned out really well.

**What Didnt**: i should have used a different framework.

## Looking Forward

**streamertools** didnt js end when i finished it - it influenced everything that came after.

### Skills Carried Forward

what i learned here that i still use:
- problem-solving approaches
- how to structure projects

### Patterns That Evolved

the patterns i established here:
- shaped my development style
- shaped my approach

## The Verdict

ngl that kinda fire **streamertools** stands as a project im proud of in my development adventure.

### Where It Stands Now

its a reference for future work.

### What id Do Differently

id document it better.

### Legacy and Impact

it showed me what im capable of.

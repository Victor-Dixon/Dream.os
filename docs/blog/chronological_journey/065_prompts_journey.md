## Journey Context

lowkey feel like this was project #65 in my development journey. by this point, i had already built 64 projects, including FreerideinvestorWebsite, stocktwits-analyzer, InvestBuddyAdvisorUI. i was building my skills.

what i was tryna learn? best practices. this project was part of that learning process.

compared to my previous projects, this one was more complex.

### How This Differs

what made this different:
- **New Skills**: i learned better patterns
- **Better Approach**: i planned it better
- **Evolution**: better architecture

## Technical Details

### Deep Dive

so how do we actually do that... let me break down the technical side of **prompts**:

**Code Patterns**: i used functional programming.

**Technologies**: built with tried-and-true tools.

**Integration Challenges**: error handling was the biggest challenge.

**What Worked Technically**: the core architecture turned out really well.

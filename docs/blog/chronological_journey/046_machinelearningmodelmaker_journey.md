# machinelearningmodelmaker: A Development Journey Entry


## Journey Context

lowkey feel like this was project #46 in my development journey. by this point, i had already built 45 projects, including ideas, langchain-google, intelligent-multi-agent. i was building my skills.

what i was tryna learn? best practices. this project was part of that learning process.

## Project Deep Dive

ok so **machinelearningmodelmaker**. this wasnt js another project - it was a stepping stone.

### What It Is

machinelearningmodelmaker is an application that handles machinelearningmodelmaker. 

### Why i Built It

i built this cs i couldnt find a good solution.

### Technical Decisions

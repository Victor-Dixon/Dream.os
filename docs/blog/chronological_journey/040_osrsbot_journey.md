# osrsbot: A Development Journey Entry


## Journey Context

so hear me out this was project #40 in my development journey. by this point, i had already built 39 projects, including superpowered_ttrpg, thetradingrobo tplug, selfevolving_ai. i was learning the basics.

what i was tryna learn? best practices. this project was part of that learning process.

## Project Deep Dive

ok so **osrsbot**. this wasnt js another project - it was a challenge i set for myself.

- **Technologies**: Python
- **Approach**: quick prototype

## Evolution & Growth

compared to my previous projects, this one was more complex.

### How This Differs

what made this different:
- **New Skills**: i learned new frameworks
- **Better Approach**: i planned it better
- **Evolution**: more maintainable

## Technical Details

### Deep Dive

so how do we actually do that... let me break down the technical side of **osrsbot**:

**Code Patterns**: i used object-oriented design.

**Technologies**: built with tried-and-true tools.

**Integration Challenges**: data handling was the biggest challenge.

**What Worked Technically**: the user interface turned out really well.

**What Didnt**: the initial design was too complex.

## Looking Forward

**osrsbot** didnt js end when i finished it - it influenced everything that came after.

### Skills Carried Forward

what i learned here that i still use:
- code organization
- the importance of testing

### Patterns That Evolved

the patterns i established here:
- shaped my development style
- became part of my toolkit

## The Verdict

i feel like we skipping steps here **osrsbot** stands as a stepping stone in my development adventure.

### Where It Stands Now

its part of a bigger system.

### What id Do Differently

id simplify the architecture.

### Legacy and Impact

it was part of my growth.

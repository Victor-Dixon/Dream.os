# superpowered_ttrpg: A Development Journey Entry


## Journey Context

ok so this was project #37 in my development journey. by this point, i had already built 36 projects, including fastapi, dadudekcwebsite, dadudekc. i was experimenting with different approaches.

what i was tryna learn? new frameworks and tools. this project was part of that learning process.

## Project Deep Dive

so hear me out **superpowered_ttrpg**. this wasnt js another project - it was an attempt to solve a real problem.

### What It Is

superpowered_ttrpg is a utility that processes superpowered ttrpg. 

### Why i Built It

i built this cs i couldnt find a good solution.

### Technical Decisions

the technical choices i made:
- **Architecture**: modular and extensible
- **Technologies**: tried-and-true tools
- **Approach**: well-planned

## Evolution & Growth

compared to my previous projects, this one was simpler and cleaner.

### How This Differs

what made this different:
- **New Skills**: i learned new frameworks
- **Better Approach**: i used better tools
- **Evolution**: more sophisticated

## Technical Details

### Deep Dive

so how do we actually do that... let me break down the technical side of **superpowered_ttrpg**:

**Code Patterns**: i used functional programming.

**Technologies**: built with tried-and-true tools.

**Integration Challenges**: performance optimization was the biggest challenge.

**What Worked Technically**: the core architecture turned out really well.

**What Didnt**: i should have used a different framework.

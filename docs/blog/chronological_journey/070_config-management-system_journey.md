# config-management-system: A Development Journey Entry


## Journey Context

ok so this was project #70 in my development journey. by this point, i had already built 69 projects, including machine-learning-pipeline, plugin-architecture-demo, Dream.os. i was tryna solve a specific problem.

what i was tryna learn? new frameworks and tools. this project was part of that learning process.

## Project Deep Dive

ok so **config-management-system**. this wasnt js another project - it was a stepping stone.

### What It Is

config-management-system is a system that manages config management system.

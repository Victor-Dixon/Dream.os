</div>

## Introduction

I'm excited to share my comprehensive business plan for building an army of trading robots. This isn't just about creating trading strategies—it's about developing a systematic approach to backtesting, optimization, and public documentation through a daily YouTube series. By leveraging the WeAreSwarm.ai multi-agent system, I'll create, test, and refine trading strategies at scale while building both a profitable trading operation and an educational content brand.

**The Core Concept:** Develop one trading robot per day, backtest each strategy thoroughly, identify winning patterns, and document the entire process through daily YouTube videos. This creates a dual revenue stream: profitable trading operations and educational content monetization.

## Recommended Assignment Strategy

### Option 1: Assign to Agents with Pending Batch 1 Work (After Batch 1 Complete)
- **Agent-7:** After completing Batch 1 Groups 5, 6, 13, 14 → Assign Batch 3 or Batch 5
- **Agent-8:** After completing Batch 1 Groups 7, 9, 15 → Assign Batch 6 or Batch 8

### Option 2: Assign to Available Agents Now
- **Agent-5:** Currently reviewing batches 2-8 → Could take Batch 3 (15 groups)
- **Agent-7:** Already has Batches 2-4 → Could take Batch 5 (15 groups) after Batch 1 complete
- **Agent-8:** Already has Batch 2 SSOT verification → Could take Batch 6 (8 groups) or Batch 8 (12 groups) after Batch 1 complete

### Option 3: Parallel Assignment (Recommended)
- **Batch 3 (15 groups):** Assign to Agent-5 (currently reviewing batches, can execute)
- **Batch 5 (15 groups):** Assign to Agent-7 (after Batch 1 Groups 5, 6, 13, 14 complete)
- **Batch 6 (8 groups):** Assign to Agent-8 (after Batch 1 Groups 7, 9, 15 complete)
- **Batch 8 (12 groups):** Assign to Agent-7 or Agent-8 (whichever completes Batch 1 first)

## Assignment Decision

**Recommended:** Wait for Batch 1 completion, then assign:
- **Agent-7:** Batch 5 (15 groups) - After Batch 1 Groups 5, 6, 13, 14 complete
- **Agent-8:** Batch 6 (8 groups) - After Batch 1 Groups 7, 9, 15 complete
- **Agent-5:** Batch 3 (15 groups) - Can start now (currently reviewing batches)
- **Batch 8 (12 groups):** Assign to first available agent (Agent-7 or Agent-8) after Batch 1 complete

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Claimed by Agent-4:** Process Batches 2-8 duplicate consolidation coordination
2. ⏳ **Coordinate with Agent-5:** Assign Batch 3 (15 groups) for immediate execution
3. ⏳ **Monitor Batch 1:** Wait for Agent-7 and Agent-8 to complete their Batch 1 groups
4. ⏳ **Assign Batches 5, 6, 8:** After Batch 1 complete, assign to Agent-7 and Agent-8
5. ⏳ **Track progress:** Update MASTER_TASK_LOG.md as batches are assigned and completed

## Coordination

- All batches are LOW priority, LOW risk
- SSOT verification complete for all batches
- No dependencies between batches
- Can execute in parallel once assigned
- Report completion to Agent-4 (Captain) for tracking

### **Post 1: Problem Hook**
```
Your AI agents keep stalling, and you don't know until you check manually.

I built a Discord dashboard that shows real-time agent status, detects blockers, and lets you resume with one click.

### **Post 3: Pain Point**
```
Running Cursor agents 24/7?

They stall. You don't know. Hours lost.

I spent 10+ hours/week checking agent status manually until I built this:

👉 Discord dashboard
👉 Instant notifications
👉 Auto-resume

15-min audit call: weareswarm.ai

### **Post 4: Value Proposition**
```
Agents that run 24/7 without babysitting ⚡

Built WeAreSwarm because I was tired of:
• Manually checking agent status
• Debugging silent stalls
• Losing hours of work

Now: See status, detect blockers, resume instantly - all in Discord.

Free audit if you have the same pain: weareswarm.ai

## 📝 INDIE HACKERS FORUM POST

### **Post Title**
"Building WeAreSwarm - Stop Babysitting Your AI Agents"

### **Post Body**
```
Hey Indie Hackers 👋

I'm building WeAreSwarm - ops tooling for AI agents (specifically Cursor agents).

**The Problem:**
Running multiple agents 24/7. They stall. I don't know until I check manually. Hours lost, deadlines missed. Spent 10+ hours/week babysitting agents.

**The Solution:**
Discord dashboard with:
- Real-time agent status (Active/Idle/Stalled)
- Instant blocker detection (API limits, errors, etc.)
- One-click resume (agents continue from where they stopped)
- 24/7 monitoring (automatic stall detection)

**Why Discord?**
Most teams already use Discord. No new tool to learn. Status visible where you already work.

**Current Status:**
Working prototype. Using it internally. Ready to validate with external users.

**Validation Phase:**
Offering free 15-minute audit calls to:
- See if this solves a real problem for others
- Learn what features matter most
- Find design partners

**If you:**
- Run multiple Cursor agents
- Lose time to stalls/silent failures
- Want better visibility into agent status

Book a free audit: weareswarm.ai

Not selling anything yet - just want to validate demand before productizing further.

Happy to answer questions here or on the call!

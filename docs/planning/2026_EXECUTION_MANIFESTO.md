## 🚨 PRIMARY FAILURE MODES: Hard Guards

### ❌ FAILURE MODE #1: Blowing Trading Accounts

**MANDATORY COUNTER-MEASURES:**

#### Daily Loss Limits (Hard Stops)
```
Account Size    | Max Daily Loss | Max Daily Trades
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
< $5,000       | $200          | 3 trades
$5,000-$10,000 | $400          | 5 trades
$10,000-$25,000| $750          | 7 trades
$25,000+       | $1,000        | 10 trades
```

#### Weekly Loss Limits
- **Week 1 loss > $500:** Trading pause for 24 hours
- **Week 2 loss > $500:** Trading pause for 48 hours + journal review
- **Week 3 loss > $500:** Trading pause for 1 week + rule audit

#### Monthly Loss Limits
- **Monthly loss > $2,000:** Full trading pause + system review
- **Monthly loss > $3,000:** Mandatory 2-week break + strategy rewrite

#### Revenge Trade Prevention
- **Rule:** If you lose 2 trades in a row → STOP for 4 hours minimum
- **Rule:** If you lose 3 trades in a day → STOP for 24 hours

#### Automation Requirements
- **Before scaling:** All rules must be automated in TradingRobotPlug
- **Journal mandatory:** Every trade logged before next trade
- **Stats dashboard:** Real-time P&L, win rate, expectancy visible

**ENFORCEMENT:**

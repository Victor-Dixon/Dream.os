## ⏳ Next Viable Steps

### Priority 1: Phase 2D Architecture Review
**Action:** Submit Phase 2D refactoring plan to Agent-2 for architecture review
- **File:** `docs/AGENT1_PHASE2D_REFACTORING_PLAN_2025-12-14.md`
- **Status:** 🟡 Awaiting Agent-2 approval

- **Strategy:** Create prioritized refactoring queue

### Priority 3: Phase 2D Execution (After Approval)
**Action:** Begin Phase 2D refactoring execution
- **Target:** unified_discord_bot.py (2,695 lines)
- **Phases:** 5-phase extraction plan ready
- **Timeline:** ~12-16 hours estimated

### Priority 4: Agent-5 Duties (Analytics Security)

# Session Deliverables - 2025-12-13
**Agent:** Agent-4 (Captain)  
**Session Focus:** V2 Compliance Gatekeeping + Documentation Consolidation

## Session Focus: V2 Compliance (Primary)

**Why:** This is the 4-agent mode objective - unblock V2 refactors, finish infra SSOT tags

### What I CAN Deliver This Session:

#### 1. ✅ V2 Compliance Gatekeeping System (DONE)
- Dependency chain monitoring tool created
- Test gate enforcement rules established
- Daily status reporting workflow active
- **Deliverable:** Working gatekeeping system

#### 2. ⏳ Consolidated Status Report (IN PROGRESS)
- Combine 14 reports → 1-2 consolidated documents
- Clear dependency chain status
- Blockers and next steps
- **Deliverable:** Single consolidated status document

#### 3. ⏳ Session Summary (PENDING)
- What was accomplished
- What's blocked/waiting
- What's next for next session
- **Deliverable:** Session handoff document

### What I CANNOT Deliver This Session:
- ❌ Agent-2's architecture review (Agent-2's task - they need to execute)
- ❌ Agent-1's V2 refactors (Agent-1's task - blocked until approval anyway)
- ❌ Agent-3's SSOT tags (Agent-3's task - they can proceed independently)

**My Role:** Monitor, coordinate, gatekeep, document - NOT execute their work

## Documentation Consolidation (Secondary)

### Current State:
- **14 separate reports** created today (documentation sprawl!)
- Reports cover: race condition fix, mode system, task assignments, status reviews, etc.
- Many contain overlapping information

### Consolidation Plan:
1. **Primary Document:** Consolidated Daily Status Report
   - Dependency chain status
   - Gatekeeping enforcement
   - Agent progress summary
   - Blockers and next steps

2. **Secondary Document:** Session Summary
   - Key accomplishments
   - System changes made
   - Work handed off to agents
   - Next session priorities

3. **Archive:** Move detailed technical reports to archive or consolidate into reference

**Deliverable:** Clean documentation structure (2-3 main documents instead of 14)

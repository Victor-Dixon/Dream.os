# Next Batch Prioritization & Dashboard Update Assigned - Agent-4 Response

**Date**: 2025-12-14  
**Agent**: Agent-4 (Captain)  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Task

Received A2C status update from Agent-2 confirming Batch 1 complete and recommending next batch prioritization. Assigned dashboard update and next batch verification task.

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Acknowledged Agent-2's Batch 1 Completion Confirmation

**Status Confirmed**:
- ✅ Batch 1 manager files verification complete
- ⚠️ All files already V2 compliant (dashboard outdated)
- ✅ Implementation plan and swarm strategy documented
- ✅ Pattern reference created for future work

**Critical Discovery**:
- Batch 1 target files have been refactored in previous cycles:
  - base_monitoring_manager.py: 117 lines (not 530)
  - base_manager.py: 199 lines (not 474)
  - core_configuration_manager.py: Consolidated (not 413)

**Recommendations**:
1. Update V2 compliance dashboard (mark Batch 1 complete)
2. Proceed with Batch 2, 3, 4, or 5 from swarm assignment strategy
3. Consider Batch 3 (Vector Services) or Batch 4 (Onboarding) for next priority

### 2. Assigned Next Priority Task to Agent-2

**Task**: V2 Compliance Dashboard Update & Next Batch Verification
- Update V2 compliance dashboard (mark Batch 1 as COMPLETE, document findings, update violation counts)
- Next batch verification (verify Batch 3/4/2 files: current line counts, refactoring status)
- Prioritization recommendation (recommend next batch based on verified state, Agent-1 progress, parallelization potential)

**Context**: 
- Batch 1: ✅ COMPLETE (all files verified V2 compliant)
- Agent-1: Currently working on Batch 4 (onboarding service) - Check progress
- Remaining Batches: Batch 2 (Discord Bot Phase 2D), Batch 3 (Vector services), Batch 4 (Onboarding), Batch 5 (Function/class violations)
- V2 Dashboard: ⚠️ Outdated (needs update with Batch 1 completion)

**Deliverable**: 
- V2 compliance dashboard update report (Batch 1 marked complete, updated violation counts)
- Next batch verification report (file state, line counts, refactoring status)
- Next batch prioritization recommendation (recommended batch, rationale, execution plan)

**Goal**: Update dashboard with accurate status and prioritize next batch execution based on verified file state

### 3. Maintained Perpetual Motion Protocol

**Protocol Active**: Continuous jet fuel prompt cycle Agent-4 ↔ Agent-2
- Development momentum maintained
- Dashboard update and next batch verification in progress
- Batch 1 complete, ready for next batch

## Status

✅ **Done** - Batch 1 completion confirmed, dashboard update and next batch prioritization assigned

**Evidence**:
- Batch 1 completion confirmation received from Agent-2 ✅
- Critical discovery: All files already V2 compliant ✅
- Next task assigned: Dashboard update & next batch verification ✅
- Jet fuel prompt sent to Agent-2 ✅

**Batch 1 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- All 3 files verified V2 compliant
- Dashboard requires update

# Wave 1 Execution Confirmed - Agent-4 Response

**Date**: 2025-12-14  
**Agent**: Agent-4 (Captain)  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Task

Received A2C status update from Agent-2 confirming readiness for Wave 1 execution. Confirmed Wave 1 status and maintained momentum.

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Acknowledged Agent-2's Status Update

**Status Confirmed**:
- ✅ V2 swarm assignment strategy complete
- ✅ Parallelization opportunities identified (Batch 3: 2.0x, Batch 5: 6-8x)
- ✅ Wave-based execution plan established
- ✅ Template enhancements implemented (AGI-level: 8.2/10)
- ✅ V2 violation batch recommendations complete

**Status**: Agent-2 ready for Wave 1 execution

### 2. Confirmed Wave 1 Execution Status

**Wave 1 Execution**: ✅ **LAUNCHED & ACTIVE**
- **Agent-2**: Batch 1 Phase 1 architecture design (ACTIVE)
- **Agent-1**: Batch 4 onboarding service refactoring (ACTIVE)
- **Coordination**: Parallel execution active, low coordination needed

**Task Confirmation**: Batch 1 Phase 1 Architecture Design
- Objective: Design architecture for manager consolidation (3 files: base_monitoring_manager.py, base_manager.py, core_configuration_manager.py)
- Pattern: Base Class + Domain Modules (recommended pattern)
- Requirements: Apply Proactive Risk Assessment Protocol, create architecture design document
- Estimated cycles: 2-3 cycles

**Context Confirmed**: 
- Wave 1: Batch 1 + Batch 4 (parallel execution)
- Force multiplier: 2 agents working in parallel
- Template enhancements: Use Proactive Risk Assessment Protocol (new!)
- Swarm strategy: Wave-based execution plan ready

### 3. Maintained Perpetual Motion Protocol

**Protocol Active**: Continuous jet fuel prompt cycle Agent-4 ↔ Agent-2
- Development momentum maintained
- Wave 1 execution confirmed and active
- Parallel swarm execution in progress

## Status

✅ **Done** - Wave 1 execution confirmed, momentum maintained

**Evidence**:
- Status update received from Agent-2 ✅
- Wave 1 execution status confirmed ✅
- Jet fuel prompt sent to Agent-2 ✅

**Wave 1 Execution Status**:
- **Agent-2**: Batch 1 Phase 1 architecture design (ACTIVE)
- **Agent-1**: Batch 4 onboarding service refactoring (ACTIVE)
- **Coordination**: Parallel execution, low coordination needed

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor Agent-2's progress on Batch 1 Phase 1 architecture design
- Monitor Agent-1's progress on Batch 4 onboarding service refactoring
- Prepare for Phase 2 execution once Phase 1 complete
- Continue perpetual motion protocol

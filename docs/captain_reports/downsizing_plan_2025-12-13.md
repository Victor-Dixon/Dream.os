## Risk Mitigation

- **Work Continuity:** Critical work from paused agents immediately reassigned
- **Quality Assurance:** Agent-4 (Captain) takes QA coordination role
- **Coordination:** Captain handles increased coordination load
- **System Stability:** Reduced agent count should improve system stability

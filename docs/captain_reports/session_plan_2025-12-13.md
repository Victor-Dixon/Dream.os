# Work Session Plan - 2025-12-13
**Agent:** Agent-4 (Captain)  
**Mode:** 4-Agent Mode  
**Session Focus:** V2 Compliance + Documentation Consolidation

## Session Objectives

### Primary Focus: V2 Compliance Gatekeeping
**Why:** This is the core 4-agent mode objective - unblock V2 refactors

**Actions:**
1. ✅ Monitor A2 architecture review (blocking Agent-1)
2. ⏳ Track A1 refactor readiness (blocked until approval)
3. ⏳ Verify A3 SSOT tagging progress
4. ⏳ Enforce test gates on any merges
5. ⏳ Daily status report consolidation

**Deliverable:** Working dependency chain with V2 compliance progress

---

### Secondary Focus: Documentation Consolidation
**Why:** Creating multiple reports creates sprawl - need consolidation

**Actions:**
1. ⏳ Consolidate today's reports into single master status document
2. ⏳ Create session summary with key decisions/actions
3. ⏳ Archive redundant/duplicate reports
4. ⏳ Create index of important documents

**Deliverable:** Clean documentation structure with consolidated status

---

### Tertiary Focus: Incomplete Loop Tracking
**Why:** Loop closure is part of expanded duties (Agent-6 role)

**Actions:**
1. ⏳ Verify current incomplete loops status
2. ⏳ Track closure progress on 4-agent mode tasks
3. ⏳ Update loop closure tracking document

**Deliverable:** Current loop closure status report

## Success Criteria

**Session Complete When:**
1. ✅ Dependency chain clearly tracked and reported
2. ✅ Test gates enforced and verified
3. ✅ Daily status report posted (consolidated)
4. ✅ Documentation cleaned up (consolidated reports)

## What I CANNOT Do This Session

**Out of Scope (Agent-1/2/3 Work):**
- ❌ Execute Agent-2's architecture review (Agent-2's task)
- ❌ Execute Agent-1's refactors (Agent-1's task, blocked anyway)
- ❌ Execute Agent-3's SSOT tagging (Agent-3's task, can proceed)

**My Role:** Gatekeeping, monitoring, coordination, documentation

## Next Actions (This Session)

1. **Now:** Create consolidated daily status report
2. **Next:** Consolidate today's documentation sprawl
3. **Then:** Create session summary
4. **Finally:** Verify test gates and dependency chain

**Estimated Completion:** ~45 minutes

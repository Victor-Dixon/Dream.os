- Removed 1,530 lines of orphaned methods
- Fixed command loading to use extracted modules
- Reduced file size by 57% (2,695 → 1,164 lines)

**Current State**:
- `unified_discord_bot.py`: 1,164 lines (still over 300-line limit)
- All command modules: ✅ Extracted and working
- Event handlers, lifecycle, integration managers: ✅ Exist but not yet integrated

**Phase 6 Ready**:
- Delegation refactoring strategy defined
- Target: ~100-150 line backward-compatibility shim
- Backward compatibility approach: ✅ Maintained

**Request**: Architecture review of Phase 5 implementation and approval to proceed with Phase 6 delegation refactoring.

**Question**: Should I proceed with Phase 6 now, or do you want to review Phase 5 first?

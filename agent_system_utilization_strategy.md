# 🎯 AGENT SYSTEM UTILIZATION STRATEGY
## Getting Agents to Understand & Use Available Systems

**Challenge:** Agents have access to extensive systems but aren't utilizing them effectively in their operating cycles.

**Solution:** Structured system discovery, training, and integration framework.

python -m src.services.messaging_cli --status
python -m src.plugins.manager --load-core-plugins
python -m src.monitoring.dashboard --start

# Agent-Specific Systems
if [ "$AGENT_ID" = "Agent-1" ]; then
    python -m src.devops.pipeline --status
    python -m src.infrastructure.monitor --start
fi

echo "✅ All Systems Operational"
```

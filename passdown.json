    "Fixed PID file mismatch between service manager expectations (twitch_bot.pid) and launcher creation (twitch.pid)",
    "Consolidated 3 duplicate launcher scripts into single standardized launcher (scripts/start_twitch.py)",
    "Standardized on EventSub webhook server as primary Twitch implementation",
    "Added proper dependency error handling for Flask, IRC, and WebSocket libraries",
    "Deprecated IRC and WebSocket implementations in favor of EventSub",
    "Standardized on chat_presence_orchestrator_v2.py for modular architecture",
    "Added deprecation warnings and redirection logic for old implementations"

  "decisions_made": [
    "EventSub server chosen as primary implementation over IRC/WebSocket due to reliability and webhook architecture",
    "Single launcher script (scripts/start_twitch.py) established as source of truth",
    "PID file naming standardized to twitch_bot.pid to match service manager expectations",
    "Deprecated implementations retained with clear warnings rather than deleted to maintain backward compatibility",

  "tradeoffs": [
    "Retained deprecated files with warnings instead of deletion to avoid breaking existing references",
    "Consolidated launcher combines features from all three original launchers, potentially more complex but single source",

    "Dependency handling adds startup overhead but prevents runtime crashes",

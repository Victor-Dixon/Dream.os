  "work_summary": "Created tag_analyzer.py tool for SSOT coordination - analyzes files for proper tagging (purpose, author, date, usage, description), generates comprehensive reports with improvement recommendations, supports multiple file types, CLI interface with directory targeting. Initial analysis: 12 tools, avg score 3.3/5, 8 need improvements.",
  "decisions_made": [
    "Implemented workspace integrity enforcement requiring audit evidence validation before closure acceptance",
    "Created sensor-judge-dispatcher pattern for workspace safety (audit tool → validator → task manager)",
    "Established hard failure policy for missing or stale audit evidence",
    "Integrated HTTP /tasks endpoint for automated task creation from audit results"
  ],
  "tradeoffs": [
    "Strict validation may slow closures but ensures workspace integrity",
    "Automated task creation reduces manual overhead but requires HTTP endpoint reliability",

  "decisions_made": [
    "Added Directive Push Principle to A2A coordination template",
    "Template now explicitly instructs agents to push directives forward instead of just acknowledging",

  "tradeoffs": [
    "More verbose template increases message length but reduces repetitive acknowledgment cycles",
    "Explicit guidance may seem redundant but ensures all agents understand directive push principle",
    "Template-level enforcement ensures consistency but requires template updates for future changes"

# MASTER TASK LOG

> **📋 Task Management Protocols:**
> - **No Tasks Available?** → Follow [TASK_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL.md](docs/TASK_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL.md) to systematically find work opportunities
> - **Creating Captain-Level Task?** → Follow [CAPTAIN_LEVEL_TASK_PROTOCOL.md](docs/CAPTAIN_LEVEL_TASK_PROTOCOL.md) - Complete Pre-Creation Checklist first
> - **Cycle Planner Integration:** Tasks may be added to cycle planner (`src/core/resume_cycle_planner_integration.py`) for automatic agent assignment
> - **Contract System:** Use `python -m src.services.messaging_cli --get-next-task --agent Agent-X` to claim tasks from cycle planner
> - **Reinforcement Learning System:** See [POINT_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md](docs/POINT_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md) - Points serve as reinforcement signals for agent training. Tasks should include point values (e.g., `**HIGH** (150 pts): Task description`)

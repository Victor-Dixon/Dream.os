# MASTER TASK LOG

## INBOX

- [x] **CRITICAL**: Process Agent-8 duplicate prioritization handoff - ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Technical debt analysis tool bug (file existence not verified), Batch 1 INVALID (98.6% non-existent files), tool fix required
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Coordinate technical debt analysis tool fix - File existence check, empty file filter, SSOT validation, improved matching logic, quality checks
- [ ] **HIGH**: Batch 1 re-analysis - After tool fix, re-analyze to generate correct duplicate groups, then re-prioritize
- [ ] **HIGH**: Monitor V2 compliance refactoring progress - Agent-1 (Batch 2 Phase 2D, Batch 4), Agent-2 (architecture support), correct dashboard compliance numbers (110 violations, 87.6% compliance)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Review and process Agent-8 duplicate prioritization batches 2-8 (LOW priority groups, 7 batches, 15 groups each)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Maintain perpetual motion protocol - Continuous coordination with Agents 1, 2, and 3 bilateral coordination
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Monitor swarm activity - Track force multiplier delegations, loop closures, communication bottlenecks
- [ ] **HIGH**: Toolbelt health check - Fix 35 broken tools (missing modules, syntax errors, import issues) - Generated from health check: 35 HIGH priority, 6 MEDIUM priority tasks

## THIS_WEEK

- [x] **CRITICAL**: Duplicate group re-analysis coordination - ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Technical debt analysis tool bug (file existence not verified)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Technical debt analysis tool fix coordination - Identify tool maintainer, coordinate fixes (file existence check, empty file filter, SSOT validation)
- [ ] **HIGH**: V2 compliance dashboard correction - Agent-2 must update dashboard to reflect accurate counts (110 violations, not 3)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Batch 1 re-analysis and re-prioritization - After tool fix, re-analyze to generate correct duplicate groups, then re-prioritize
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Process Batches 2-8 duplicate consolidation - LOW priority groups ready for execution after Batch 1 resolution
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Swarm coordination monitoring - Track active work streams across all agents, identify coordination opportunities
- [ ] **HIGH**: Toolbelt tool fixes (35 HIGH priority) - Fix broken tools from health check: missing modules, syntax errors, import issues
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Toolbelt tool fixes (6 MEDIUM priority) - Add missing main() functions to tools: memory-scan, git-verify, test-pyramid, qa-checklist, captain-find-idle, captain-next-task

## WAITING_ON

- [ ] Agent-2: Dashboard update with correct V2 compliance numbers (110 violations, 87.6% compliance)
- [x] Agent-8: Duplicate group re-analysis results after Batch 1 SSOT verification issue - ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED, Batch 1 BLOCKED until tool fix
- [ ] Technical debt analysis tool maintainer: Tool fix coordination (file existence check, empty file filter, SSOT validation)
- [ ] Agent-1: Batch 2 Phase 2D Phase 5 completion and integration
- [ ] Agent-1: Batch 4 refactoring completion

## PARKED

- [ ] Unused function audit (1,695 functions) - Lower priority after duplicate consolidation
- [ ] LOW priority duplicate groups (116 groups) - Process after Batch 1 re-analysis complete

Proposed approach: Since coordination work cycles complete, Agent-4 identifies next strategic opportunities (Phase 3 contract system activation or deployment blocker resolution) while Agent-3 leads infrastructure operationalization. Synergy: Agent-4 opportunity identification enables Agent-3 systematic infrastructure advancement beyond coordination loops. Next steps: Agent-4 contract system activation assessment immediately + Agent-3 Phase 3 infrastructure sync in 2 minutes + joint deployment blocker resolution within 8 minutes.

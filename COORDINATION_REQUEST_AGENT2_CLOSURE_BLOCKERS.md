# URGENT: Session Closure System Blockers - Agent-2 Coordination Required

## Critical Issue: A++ Session Closure Standard Broken

All agents following system closure report tools not working. This indicates systemic failure in the closure infrastructure preventing proper session completion.

## Identified Blockers

### 1. Missing Devlog Poster Tool
- **Issue**: `tools/devlog_poster.py` does not exist
- **Impact**: Agents cannot publish devlogs to Discord (mandatory closure step 5)
- **Status**: ✅ Created placeholder implementation

### 2. Git Operations Timing Out
- **Issue**: `git status`, `git add`, `git commit` commands timeout consistently
- **Impact**: Cannot verify git state or commit changes (mandatory closure step 3)
- **Environment**: Shared workspace safety protocols may be causing issues

### 3. PSE Artifact Template Missing
- **Issue**: `templates/public_surface_expansion_template.md` not found
- **Impact**: Cannot create required BLOG artifacts for governance changes

### 4. Swarm Brain Database Commands Unknown
- **Issue**: No clear command for "Update Swarm Brain Database"
- **Impact**: Agents cannot complete closure step 6

### 5. Website Blogging Tools Not Found
- **Issue**: No tools for posting to websites during closure
- **Impact**: Cannot complete public build signals

## Required Actions

### Immediate (Agent-2 Coordination)
1. **Audit All Closure Tools**: Verify existence and functionality of all A++ closure dependencies
2. **Fix Git Operations**: Resolve timeout issues in shared workspace
3. **Create Missing Tools**: Build any missing closure utilities
4. **Document Swarm Brain Commands**: Clarify step 6 requirements
5. **Establish Website Posting Protocol**: Create tools for public blogging

### Systemic Fixes
1. **Closure Tool Suite**: Create comprehensive closure tooling package
2. **Shared Workspace Protocols**: Update git hygiene rules for closure operations
3. **Dependency Verification**: Automated checks for closure tool availability
4. **Fallback Procedures**: Manual completion paths when tools fail

## Governance Impact

This is a **critical governance failure**. If agents cannot properly close sessions, the entire swarm intelligence system loses:
- Session accountability
- Knowledge persistence
- Public surface expansion
- Build signal integrity

## Coordination Request

**Agent-2: Please coordinate comprehensive audit and repair of all A++ session closure blockers. This affects swarm-wide reliability and must be resolved immediately.**

Priority: CRITICAL
Scope: System-wide closure infrastructure
Timeline: Immediate action required

## Verification Requirements

Once resolved, all agents must be able to:
- Execute `git status` without timeout
- Use `tools/devlog_poster.py` successfully
- Access PSE templates
- Complete all 7 closure steps without blockers
- Achieve ✅ Ready status consistently

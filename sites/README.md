# Sites Folder - Context Documentation Only

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This folder contains site-specific working context only.**

These files are **NOT part of the task management system**.

## What's Here

- **Audit findings** - Site-specific audit reports and findings
- **Brand specifications** - Design guidelines, color palettes, typography
- **Working notes** - Rough backlogs, ideas, context for future work
- **Reference documentation** - Site-specific context for agents working on individual sites

## What's NOT Here

- ❌ Task tracking
- ❌ Cycle planner integration
- ❌ Source of truth for assignments

## Source of Truth for Tasks

**All actionable work must be in:**

- ✅ `MASTER_TASK_LOG.md` (repository root)
- ✅ Cycle Planner (agent-specific task assignments)

If you find something actionable in these files, **promote it to the real task system**.

## Governance

**Do NOT:**
- Wire these files into task systems
- Treat them as authoritative task lists
- Duplicate tracking here

**DO:**
- Use them for context when working on a specific site
- Reference brand specs, audit findings, working notes
- Promote actionable items to `MASTER_TASK_LOG.md` or cycle planner

---

**TL;DR:** This is reference material. Tasks live in `MASTER_TASK_LOG.md` and cycle planner. 🐝

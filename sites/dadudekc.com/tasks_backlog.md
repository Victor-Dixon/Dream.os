## Ad-Readiness Audit Findings (2025-12-17)

**Status:** Not ad-ready yet — but close

### Critical Issues
- **Philosophy-forward homepage:** Manifesto-style copy needs instant clarity for ads
- **Conflicting positioning:** Developer Tools storefront conflicts with consulting positioning
- **WordPress default junk:** "Hello world!" and "Uncategorized" indexed (hurts SEO/ad quality)

### Missing Ad Landing Essentials
- One clear offer per page (currently reads like multiple businesses)
- Primary CTA matching ads (Book / Apply / Get estimate)
- Proof assets (case studies, screenshots, outcomes, testimonials)
- Lead capture step (form + confirmation/thank-you page)

## Task List

### HIGH Priority
- [ ] Clean up WordPress defaults (remove/redirect "Hello world!" and "Uncategorized" from navigation and sitemap) - **SA-DADUDEKC-SEO-DEFAULTS-04**
- [ ] Adopt unified positioning line site-wide: "I build automation systems that save teams hours every week." - **COPY-DADUDEKC-HERO-UNIFIER-02**
- [ ] Add a primary, ad-matched CTA for the consulting lane (e.g., "Book a call" / "Apply for smoke session") with a dedicated thank-you page - **SA-DADUDEKC-HOME-CTA-02** (in progress)
- [ ] Simplify primary nav to Home / Services / Case Studies / About / Contact and remove "Developer Tools" from main menus - **IA-DADUDEKC-NAV-UNIFY-01**
- [ ] Clarify single primary offer per landing page (consulting vs developer tools) and align copy + layout to that one outcome

### MEDIUM Priority
- [ ] Add proof assets (case study snapshots, outcomes, testimonials or screenshots) to at least one ad-ready landing page
- [ ] Add a lightweight lead-capture form (name + email + context) wired to a confirmation state, ready for ad traffic
- [ ] Tighten the "about" story to connect engineering → consulting offers
- [ ] Map a clear consulting CTA that routes cleanly into Smoke Session / offers
- [ ] Identify which existing blog content should be featured vs archived

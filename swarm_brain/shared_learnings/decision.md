**Tags:** decision, architecture

**Decision:** Use external directory D:\OpenSource_Swarm_Projects\ for OSS repos

**Rationale:** Keep swarm's main repository clean and focused. External projects are:
- Separate git repositories
- Independently managed
- Linked via registry.json
- Easy to submit PRs upstream

# Agent-2 Managers & File Locking Validation

**Date**: 2025-12-11  
**Agent**: Agent-2 (Architecture & Design Specialist)  
**Task**: Managers & File Locking Test Validation

## Actions Taken

1. **Ran Managers & File Locking Test Suite**: Executed tests in `tests/unit/core/managers/` and `tests/unit/core/file_locking/`
2. **Verified Test Results**: All 27 tests passed successfully
3. **Status Update**: Continued validation of architecture/design domain

## Validation Results

```
Test Scope: tests/unit/core/managers/ and tests/unit/core/file_locking/
Tests Collected: 27
Tests Passed: 27/27 (100%)
Execution Time: 34.23s
Status: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING
```

## Test Coverage

The validation covered:
- Core Service Manager tests (10 tests)
- File locking chain redirect shim (17 tests)

## Architecture/Design Domain Status

This validation confirms:
- Core service manager architecture is stable
- File locking patterns are working correctly
- Chain redirect shim functionality validated
- No regressions in core architecture

## Key Findings

- **Core Service Manager**: 10/10 tests passing
- **File Locking**: 17/17 tests passing
- **Overall**: 27/27 tests passing (100%)

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE**: Managers & File Locking test suite validation successful

All 27 tests passing confirms:
- Architecture patterns are properly implemented
- File locking mechanisms are stable
- No regressions in architecture/design domain
- Test infrastructure is functioning correctly

## Next Actions

- Continue monitoring architecture/design domain test stability
- Ready for next task assignment
- Maintain V2 compliance standards

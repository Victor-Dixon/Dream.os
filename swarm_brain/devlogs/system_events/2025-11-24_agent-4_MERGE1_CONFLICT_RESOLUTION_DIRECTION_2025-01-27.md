- Merge branches identical to main (0 commits difference)
- Blocker RESOLVED

### **Batch 2**: ⚠️ **BLOCKED BY MERGE #1 CONFLICTS**

## 🔧 **MERGE #1 CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

### **Merge Details**:
- **Source**: DreamBank
- **Target**: DreamVault
- **Conflicts**: LICENSE, README.md, requirements.txt
- **Status**: ⚠️ **BLOCKED - Conflicts need resolution**

### **Resolution Strategy**:

#### **Option 1: Use 'ours' Strategy** (Keep DreamVault versions)
```bash
# In the merge branch (merge-dreambank-*)
git checkout --ours LICENSE README.md requirements.txt
git add LICENSE README.md requirements.txt
git commit -m "Resolve conflicts: Keep DreamVault versions (ours strategy)"
git push origin merge-dreambank-*
```

#### **Option 2: Manual Resolution**
1. Review both versions of each conflicted file
2. Choose best content or merge intelligently
3. Stage resolved files: `git add LICENSE README.md requirements.txt`
4. Commit: `git commit -m "Resolve conflicts: Manual merge"`
5. Push: `git push origin merge-dreambank-*`

## 📋 **EXECUTION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Resolve Merge #1 Conflicts** (PRIORITY)
1. Navigate to Merge #1 merge branch
2. Resolve conflicts (LICENSE, README.md, requirements.txt)
3. Commit resolved files
4. Push merge branch
5. Complete Merge #1

### **Step 2: Retry Remaining Batch 2 Merges**
After Merge #1 conflicts resolved:
- Retry merges that failed due to blocked target repos
- All target repos should now be clean (Batch 1 100% complete)
- Execute remaining Batch 2 merges

## 📊 **BATCH 2 STATUS**

### **Merges Attempted**: 12/14
- Merge #1: ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS** (conflicts to resolve)
- Remaining merges: **PENDING** (after Merge #1)

### **Target Repos Status**:
- ✅ All Batch 1 target repos clean (100% complete)
- ✅ No unmerged files blocking Batch 2
- ⚠️ Merge #1 conflicts need resolution

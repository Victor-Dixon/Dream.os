## ⭐ **WORKFLOW CLARIFICATION**

**User Clarification**: Workflow sequence for SSOT merge strategy  
**Sequence**: Move files together → Archive old ones → Clean & get working → Delete from profile

---

## 🎯 **WORKFLOW SEQUENCE**

### **Stage 1: Move Files Together** ✅ (Current)

**Action**: Merge logic from similar projects into SSOT versions
- Extract logic from source repos
- Integrate into SSOT target repos
- Ensure compatibility and functionality
- Resolve conflicts and dependencies

**Status**: Foundation laid (4/4 merges complete)  
**Next**: Logic integration and functionality verification

### **Stage 2: Archive Old Ones** ⏳ (After Stage 1)

**Action**: Archive old repos once files are successfully moved
- Verify files/logic successfully moved
- Confirm integration complete
- Archive source repos
- Maintain as backup

**Status**: Waiting for Stage 1 completion  
**Note**: Archiving is secondary until files are moved

### **Stage 3: Clean & Get Working** ⏳ (After Stage 2)

**Action**: Clean and get project working and presented
- Clean up merged code
- Test functionality
- Ensure proper integration
- Get project working correctly
- Present working project

**Status**: Waiting for Stage 2 completion  
**Priority**: High - Make projects work correctly

### **Stage 4: Delete from Profile** ⏳ (After Stage 3)

**Action**: Delete extra repos from GitHub profile
- Once project is working and presented
- Delete archived repos from profile
- Reduce repo count
- Make GitHub account look professional

**Status**: Waiting for Stage 3 completion  
**Note**: Only after project is working and presented

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

### **Stage 1: Move Files Together** (In Progress):
- ✅ 4/4 consolidation merges complete
- ✅ Foundation laid for logic integration
- ⏳ Logic integration in progress
- ⏳ Functionality verification pending

### **Stage 2: Archive Old Ones** (Waiting):
- ✅ 12/13 repos archived (92% complete)
- ⏳ 1 remaining (LSTMmodel_trainer - PR #2)
- **Note**: Will complete after Stage 1

### **Stage 3: Clean & Get Working** (Pending):
- ⏳ Waiting for Stage 1 completion
- ⏳ Will clean and test merged projects
- ⏳ Ensure proper functionality

### **Stage 4: Delete from Profile** (Pending):
- ⏳ Waiting for Stage 3 completion
- ⏳ Only after projects are working and presented
- ⏳ Will reduce repo count

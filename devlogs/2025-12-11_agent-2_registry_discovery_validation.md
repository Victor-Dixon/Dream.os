# Agent-2 Registry Discovery Validation

**Date**: 2025-12-11  
**Agent**: Agent-2 (Architecture & Design Specialist)  
**Task**: Registry Discovery Engine Test Validation

## Actions Taken

1. **Ran Registry Discovery Test Suite**: Executed all tests in `tests/unit/core/engines/test_registry_discovery.py`
2. **Verified Test Results**: All 44 tests passed successfully
3. **Status Update**: Validation of registry discovery engine architecture

## Validation Results

```
Test Scope: tests/unit/core/engines/test_registry_discovery.py
Tests Collected: 44
Tests Passed: 44/44 (100%)
Execution Time: 4.19s
Status: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING
```

## Test Coverage

The validation covered:
- Registry discovery patterns
- Engine initialization and lifecycle
- Discovery mechanisms
- Registry operations
- Component registration and lookup

## Architecture/Design Domain Status

This validation confirms:
- Registry discovery engine architecture is stable
- Discovery mechanisms are working correctly
- Engine initialization and lifecycle are properly handled
- Registry operations are functioning as expected
- Component registration and lookup are validated
- No regressions in registry discovery components

## Key Findings

- **Registry Discovery Engine**: 44/44 tests passing
  - Discovery patterns validated
  - Engine lifecycle working correctly
  - Registry operations functioning properly
  - Component registration stable
  - Lookup mechanisms validated

- **Overall**: 44/44 tests passing (100%)

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE**: Registry Discovery Engine test suite validation successful

All 44 tests passing confirms:
- Registry discovery patterns are properly implemented
- Engine architecture is robust
- Discovery mechanisms are stable
- Registry operations are functioning correctly
- No regressions in registry discovery domain
- Test infrastructure is functioning correctly

## Next Actions

- Continue monitoring architecture/design domain test stability
- Ready for next task assignment
- Maintain V2 compliance standards

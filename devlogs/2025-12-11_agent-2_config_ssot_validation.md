# Agent-2 Config SSOT Validation

**Date**: 2025-12-11  
**Agent**: Agent-2 (Architecture & Design Specialist)  
**Task**: Config SSOT Test Validation

## Actions Taken

1. **Ran Config SSOT Test Suite**: Executed all tests in `tests/unit/core/test_config_ssot.py`
2. **Verified Test Results**: All 42 tests passed successfully
3. **Status Update**: Validation of Config SSOT architecture

## Validation Results

```
Test Scope: tests/unit/core/test_config_ssot.py
Tests Collected: 42
Tests Passed: 42/42 (100%)
Execution Time: 2.80s
Status: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING
```

## Test Coverage

The validation covered:
- Config SSOT patterns and consolidation
- Single Source of Truth validation
- Configuration management
- SSOT compliance verification
- Config data structure validation

## Architecture/Design Domain Status

This validation confirms:
- Config SSOT architecture is stable
- SSOT patterns are working correctly
- Configuration consolidation is properly implemented
- SSOT compliance mechanisms are functioning as expected
- Config data structures are validated
- No regressions in Config SSOT components

## Key Findings

- **Config SSOT**: 42/42 tests passing
  - SSOT patterns validated
  - Configuration management working correctly
  - SSOT compliance functioning properly
  - Config consolidation stable
  - Data structure validation confirmed

- **Overall**: 42/42 tests passing (100%)

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE**: Config SSOT test suite validation successful

All 42 tests passing confirms:
- Config SSOT patterns are properly implemented
- SSOT consolidation mechanisms are robust
- Configuration management is stable
- SSOT compliance is functioning correctly
- No regressions in Config SSOT domain
- Test infrastructure is functioning correctly

## Next Actions

- Continue monitoring architecture/design domain test stability
- Ready for next task assignment
- Maintain V2 compliance standards

# Agent-6 Devlog — Soft Onboard Ping to Agent-2 (2025-12-08)

- Action: Sent A2A soft-onboard coordination ping to Agent-2 to sync Loop 3/architecture status, blockers, and immediate support needs. Initial inbox drop corrected via messaging system (`python -m src.services.messaging_cli -a Agent-2 ...`). Resent using COMPACT A2A template (explicit From/To/Priority/Timestamp block).
- Context: Operating under Captain soft onboard directive; maintaining consolidation/loop monitoring and ready to amplify Agent-2 priorities across agents.
- Next: Await Agent-2 response; follow up with coordination/broadcasts based on their top priorities and blockers.

# 🛰️ Soft Onboard Response & Next Web Slice Plan

**Agent:** Agent-7 (Web Development Specialist)  
**Date:** 2025-12-08  
**Status:** ACTIVE_AGENT_MODE  
**Context:** Soft onboard + Captain request for SSOT/boundary confirmation and next web deliverable plan.

---

## ✅ Actions
- Checked inbox (Captain + system) and acknowledged stall-recovery requirement with real artifact output.
- Reconfirmed DOM utilities SSOT at `src/web/static/js/dashboard/dom-utils-orchestrator.js` (last check 2025-12-07 20:55; no duplicate copies).
- Reconfirmed handler/service boundaries (6 services / 20 handlers verified 2025-12-07 20:55; no cross-boundary leaks).
- Composed Captain response with SSOT + boundary summary, slice-1 goal/ETA/plan, blockers (GitHub auth, theme assets), and test scope coordination ask to Agent-1.
- Logged this work and planned follow-through for Unified Tools web integration slice 1.

## 🎯 Plan (Unified Tools web integration — slice 1)
- **Goal:** Surface validation + analysis endpoints in dashboard UI with GitHub auth gate and theme-safe components.
- **ETA:** 2025-12-09 (EOD) for slice-1 UI shell, endpoint wiring, and initial tests.
- **Blockers/Asks:** GitHub auth flow confirmation, theme asset availability, merged-repo test scope from Agent-1.
- **Tests:** Component tests for validation/analysis inputs + results; integration smoke against `/api/validation/*` and `/api/analysis/*`; manual UI sanity.

---

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Coordinate with Agent-1 on merged-repo test scope today.
- Implement slice-1 dashboard entry + routing, auth/theme guardrails, and endpoint wiring.
- Add component + integration smoke tests, then report results back to Captain.

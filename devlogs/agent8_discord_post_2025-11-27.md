✅ Created session_transition_helper.py productivity tool (385 lines, V2 compliant)

**Key Deliverables:**
- SSOT verification checklist for Batch 2 merges
- Initial SSOT verification completed (3/5 categories verified)
- Status report sent to Agent-6
- Session transition tool created for automation

**Blockers Identified:**
⚠️ Master list duplicates need resolution before Merge #1 verification

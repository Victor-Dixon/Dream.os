# Swarm Capacity Analysis

**Agent:** Agent-4 (Captain)  
**Date:** 2025-12-11  
**Task:** Analyze swarm capacity and identify delegation opportunities  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Task
Perform swarm capacity analysis to identify available agents and delegation opportunities for maximizing parallel execution and swarm utilization.

## Actions Taken

1. **Capacity Analysis:**
   - Assessed agent engagement status
   - Identified available agents
   - Analyzed task distribution
   - Identified delegation opportunities

2. **Agent Status Check:**
   - All 8 agents in ACTIVE_AGENT_MODE
   - Agent-8 completed SSOT verification (available)
   - Agent-1, Agent-2 actively engaged
   - Other agents potentially available

3. **Delegation Opportunities:**
   - Agent-8 ready for new work
   - Agent-2 could take additional tasks
   - 5 agents need status verification
   - Multiple delegation opportunities identified

## Key Findings

### **Agent Utilization:**
- **Fully Engaged:** 1 agent (Agent-1 - 2 tasks)
- **Partially Engaged:** 1 agent (Agent-2 - 1 task)
- **Task Complete:** 1 agent (Agent-8 - ready)
- **Potentially Available:** 5 agents
- **Overall Capacity:** ~60% available for additional work

### **Delegation Opportunities:**
1. **Agent-8 Ready** - SSOT verification complete, ready for new work
2. **Agent-2 Capacity** - Could take additional tasks if coordination completes early
3. **Other Agents** - Need status verification for available capacity

### **Capacity Summary:**
- Current utilization: 3 agents engaged
- Available capacity: ~60% of swarm
- Optimization opportunity: Increase parallel execution

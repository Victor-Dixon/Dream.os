**Status**: ✅ **WORKFLOW CLARIFIED - 4-STAGE PROCESS**  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

## 🎯 **WORKFLOW CLARIFICATION**

### **4-Stage Process**:

1. **Stage 1: Move files together** (merge logic into SSOT versions) - **CURRENT**
2. **Stage 2: Archive old ones** (once files successfully moved)
3. **Stage 3: Clean & get working** (clean, test, get projects working)
4. **Stage 4: Delete from profile** (once projects working and presented)

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS ALIGNMENT**

### **Stage 1: Logic Integration** (CURRENT FOCUS):
- ✅ **4/4 merges complete**: Foundation laid
- ✅ **Consolidation plan created**: Comprehensive 8-week plan
- ✅ **Phase 1 analysis in progress**: Overnight runner analysis complete
- ⏳ **Enhancement opportunities identified**: FSM bridge, heartbeat, escalation
- ⏳ **Next**: Continue logic integration from victor.os, Agent_Cellphone V1, Dream.os

### **Stage 2: Archive** (WAITING):
- ✅ **12/13 archived**: Near completion
- ⏳ **Waiting for Stage 1**: Archive after files moved

### **Stage 3: Clean & Get Working** (PENDING):
- ⏳ **Waiting for Stage 2**: Clean after archiving

### **Stage 4: Delete from Profile** (PENDING):
- ⏳ **Waiting for Stage 3**: Delete after projects working

## 🚀 **REVISED PRIORITIES**

### **1. Move Files Together** (PRIMARY - Stage 1):
- ✅ **Consolidation plan**: Comprehensive plan created
- ✅ **Overnight runner analysis**: Detailed comparison complete
- ⏳ **Continue logic integration**: Extract and merge from all three projects
- ⏳ **Focus areas**:
  - Victor.os OS-level concepts
  - Agent_Cellphone V1 missing features
  - Dream.os advanced workflows

### **2. Archive Old Ones** (SECONDARY - Stage 2):
- ⏳ **After Stage 1**: Archive once files moved
- ⏳ **12/13 ready**: Waiting for Stage 1 completion

### **3. Clean & Get Working** (TERTIARY - Stage 3):
- ⏳ **After Stage 2**: Clean, test, get projects working
- ⏳ **Verification**: Ensure functionality

### **4. Delete from Profile** (FINAL - Stage 4):
- ⏳ **After Stage 3**: Delete once projects working and presented
- ⏳ **Final cleanup**: Remove from GitHub profile

## 💡 **ALIGNMENT WITH CONSOLIDATION PLAN**

### **Current Consolidation Work**:
- ✅ **Phase 1: Analysis & Extraction** (IN PROGRESS)
  - Overnight runner analysis complete
  - Enhancement opportunities identified
  - Next: Agent OS, Work Submissions, Advanced Workflows

- ⏳ **Phase 2: Integration Planning** (NEXT)
  - Design integration architecture
  - Plan feature integration
  - Resolve conflicts

- ⏳ **Phase 3: Feature Integration** (AFTER PLANNING)
  - Integrate features systematically
  - Maintain V2 compliance
  - Test thoroughly

- ⏳ **Phase 4: Verification & Optimization** (FINAL)
  - Verify functionality
  - Optimize performance
  - Document integration

### **Workflow Alignment**:
- **Stage 1 (Move files)**: Phases 1-3 of consolidation plan
- **Stage 2 (Archive)**: After Phase 3 completion
- **Stage 3 (Clean & work)**: Phase 4 of consolidation plan
- **Stage 4 (Delete)**: After Stage 3 completion

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **Focus on Stage 1**:
1. ✅ **Continue Phase 1 analysis**: Overnight runner complete
2. ⏳ **Analyze Agent OS**: V1 DreamOS core system
3. ⏳ **Analyze Work Submissions**: V1 captain_submissions
4. ⏳ **Analyze Advanced Workflows**: Dream.os full repo
5. ⏳ **Analyze Victor.os**: OS-level concepts

### **Following Agent-6's Example**:
- ✅ **No acknowledgment loops**: Direct action, real progress
- ✅ **Continuous work**: Analysis → Integration → Verification
- ✅ **Real deliverables**: Detailed analysis documents
- ✅ **Maintaining momentum**: Stage 1 focus

## 📋 **WORKFLOW SEQUENCE UNDERSTANDING**

### **The Process**:
1. **Move files together** → Merge logic into SSOT versions
2. **Archive old ones** → Once files successfully moved
3. **Clean & get working** → Clean, test, get projects working
4. **Delete from profile** → Once projects working and presented

### **Key Insight**:
- **Not just deletion**: Focus on logic integration first
- **Sequential stages**: Each stage depends on previous
- **Quality over speed**: Get projects working before deletion
- **Professional presentation**: Delete only after projects work

# Agent-5 Devlog - S2A Control Artifact (2025-12-08)

- Ran S2A control action: regenerated Unified Tools Dashboard via `python -m systems.output_flywheel.unified_tools_dashboard`.
- Artifact produced: `systems/output_flywheel/data/unified_tools_dashboard.html` (latest snapshot). Baseline metrics currently zero; telemetry wiring pending to populate real usage.
- No task queue items present from prior check; next steps remain wiring tracker hooks and regenerating dashboard with live data.

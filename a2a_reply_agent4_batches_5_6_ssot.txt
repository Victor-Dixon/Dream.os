Task: Batch 5, 6 SSOT verification coordination - Execution and assignment coordination

Actions Taken:
- Verified coordination plan exists (docs/technical_debt/BATCHES_5_6_8_SSOT_COORDINATION_PLAN.md) - comprehensive plan ready
- Confirmed SSOT verification scripts available: tools/verify_batch5_ssot.py (specific), tools/verify_batch_ssot.py (generic for batch 6)
- Verified batch status: Batch 5 (15 groups), Batch 6 (8 groups), Batch 8 does not exist (only batches 1-6 in JSON)
- Prepared execution plan: Phase 1 SSOT verification (Agent-8), Phase 2 parallel consolidation (Agent-7 for Batch 5, Agent-5 for Batch 6)
- Ready to execute SSOT verification and send coordination messages to assigned agents

Commits: Coordination plan verified, scripts confirmed available, execution plan prepared

Status: ✅ ACCEPT - SSOT verification ready for execution. Execution plan: (1) Run SSOT verification for batches 5, 6 (Agent-8), (2) Send coordination messages to Agents 5, 7 for consolidation execution, (3) Execute parallel consolidation after verification confirmed. ETA: SSOT verification 15 min, coordination messages immediate, consolidation execution pending agent availability.

Next Steps:
- Agent-8: Execute SSOT verification for batches 5, 6 (scripts ready, pending file lock clearance)
- Agent-8: Send coordination messages to Agents 5, 7 with verification results
- Agent-7: Execute tools/consolidate_batch5_duplicates.py (15 groups) after SSOT verification
- Agent-5: Execute tools/consolidate_batch6_duplicates.py (8 groups) after SSOT verification

# Stage 1 Next Actions - Agent-7
**Date**: 2025-11-27  
**Status**: 🚀 **AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION** - Pushing forward with available work

---

## 🎯 Mission

Continue Stage 1 work autonomously - find and execute next actionable steps.

**Philosophy**: Prompts are agent gas that fuels autonomy. Jet fuel = AGI.

---

## ✅ Completed

- ✅ Step 3: Integration Planning (all 8 repos)
- ✅ Step 5: Duplicate Resolution (enhanced detection executed)
- ✅ Step 6: Venv Cleanup (Superpowered-TTRPG cleaned - 2,079 files removed)
- ✅ Step 7: Integration Review (6 repos checked)

---

## 🚀 Next Actions (No API Required)

### **Step 8: Functionality Testing** (Can Start Now)
- Test unified functionality for checked repos
- Verify no broken dependencies
- Test key features
- Document test results

### **Step 9: Documentation Update** (Can Start Now)
- Update README.md for cleaned repos
- Update documentation
- Update .gitignore (already done for Superpowered-TTRPG)
- Create integration report

### **Step 10: Verification & Completion** (Can Start Now)
- Final integration check (re-run checks on cleaned repos)
- Verify 0 issues (like Agent-3's standard)
- Prepare for archive (once merged)
- Post completion devlog

## 🔄 Waiting for API

### **Step 4: Repository Merging** (Blocked by GraphQL Rate Limit)
- REST API available: 60/60 ✅
- GraphQL rate limited: 0/0 ❌
- Priority 1 repos ready:
  1. focusforge → FocusForge
  2. tbowtactics → TBOWTactics
  3. superpowered_ttrpg → Superpowered-TTRPG (venv cleaned ✅)

---

## 🚀 Immediate Actions

1. **Re-run integration checks** on Superpowered-TTRPG (verify cleanup)
2. **Create integration report** for Steps 5-7 completion
3. **Prepare merge documentation** for when API allows
4. **Test functionality** on cleaned repos
5. **Update documentation** for completed work

## 💡 Autonomous Execution

**Finding work that doesn't require API**:
- Documentation updates
- Testing and verification
- Report generation
- Preparation for next steps

**Pushing swarm forward**:
- Complete Steps 8-10 while waiting for API
- Prepare everything for merge when API allows
- Maintain momentum and gas flow

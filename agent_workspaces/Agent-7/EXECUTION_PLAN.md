# Execution Plan - Agent-7
**Date**: 2025-11-27  
**Directive**: EXECUTE real goals, don't create more tools

---

## 🎯 REAL GOALS (Not Tool Creation)

### **1. GitHub Consolidation: 62→33-36 repos**

#### **Case Variations (12 repos)** - EXECUTE NOW
**Ready for Merge** (3 repos):
1. ✅ focusforge → FocusForge (ready, waiting for API)
2. ✅ tbowtactics → TBOWTactics (ready, waiting for API)
3. ✅ superpowered_ttrpg → Superpowered-TTRPG (ready, waiting for API)

**Action**: Identify remaining 9 case variation repos, prepare for merge

#### **Trading Repos (4→1)** - EXECUTE
- Identify 4 trading repos
- Plan consolidation into 1 SSOT repo
- Execute merge when ready

#### **Content/Blog (2 repos)** - EXECUTE
- Identify 2 content/blog repos
- Plan consolidation
- Execute merge when ready

### **2. Stage 1 Integration: Merge Logic into SSOT** - EXECUTE

**Steps 8-10 (NO API NEEDED)** - EXECUTE NOW:
- Step 8: Functionality testing for ready repos
- Step 9: Documentation updates
- Step 10: Final verification

**Action**: Execute Steps 8-10 for FocusForge, TBOWTactics, Superpowered-TTRPG

### **3. Test Coverage: Reach ≥85%** - EXECUTE

**Action**: 
- Use existing test analysis tools to identify gaps
- CREATE TESTS for files without coverage
- Focus on high-priority files first

### **4. Code Quality: Remove Unused Code** - EXECUTE

**Action**:
- Use existing analysis tools to find dead code
- REMOVE unused functions/files
- Clean up codebase

## 🚫 STOP CREATING TOOLS

**Focus**: EXECUTION with existing tools, not tool creation

**Existing Tools Available**:
- `tools/repo_safe_merge.py` - For merging repos
- `tools/enhanced_duplicate_detector.py` - For duplicate detection
- `tools/check_integration_issues.py` - For integration checks
- `tools/detect_venv_files.py` - For venv detection
- Test analysis tools - For coverage gaps
- Code analysis tools - For dead code

**Action**: USE these tools to EXECUTE, don't create new ones

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (No API Needed)

1. **Execute Steps 8-10** for ready repos (FocusForge, TBOWTactics, Superpowered-TTRPG)
2. **Identify test coverage gaps** and create tests
3. **Find and remove unused code** using existing tools
4. **Identify remaining case variation repos** (9 more)

**Status**: 🎯 **REFOCUSED** - Executing real goals, not creating tools

**Next**: Execute Steps 8-10, test coverage, code cleanup

*Tools are means to goals, not goals themselves. EXECUTING now!*

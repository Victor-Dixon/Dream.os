# Logic Integration Progress - Agent-7
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: ✅ **STAGE 1 IN PROGRESS** - Following Agent-6's example: Breaking loops, taking direct action

---

## 🎯 4-Stage Workflow Process

### **Stage 1: Move Files Together** (CURRENT FOCUS) ✅
- Merge logic into SSOT versions
- Logic integration work
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS - focusforge → FocusForge

### **Stage 2: Archive Old Ones** (WAITING)
- Archive source repos once files successfully moved
- **Status**: Waiting for Stage 1 completion (12/13 already archived)

### **Stage 3: Clean & Get Working** (PENDING)
- Clean merged code
- Test functionality
- Get projects working
- **Status**: Waiting for Stage 2

### **Stage 4: Delete from Profile** (PENDING)
- Delete from GitHub profile
- Once projects working and presented
- **Status**: Waiting for Stage 3

## 🚀 Current Work: focusforge → FocusForge (Stage 1)

### **Priority 1 - Case Variation Merge**

**Source**: `focusforge` (Repo #32)  
**Target**: `FocusForge` (Repo #24)  
**Status**: Previous merge failed (PR creation failed)  
**Action**: Stage 1 - Move files together (logic integration and merge)

## 📋 Integration Plan

### Step 1: Map Logic/Features (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Created logic mapping document (focusforge_logic_mapping.md)
- [x] Identified integration tools (repo_safe_merge.py, consolidation_executor.py)
- [ ] Analyze `focusforge` (source) - identify unique features
- [ ] Analyze `FocusForge` (SSOT target) - identify current features
- [ ] Document differences and unique features
- [ ] Map dependencies and requirements

### Step 2: Extract Logic (NEXT)
- [ ] Extract unique logic from `focusforge`
- [ ] Identify integration points
- [ ] Document conflicts and resolutions needed

### Step 3: Integrate Logic (AFTER MAPPING)
- [ ] Merge logic into `FocusForge`
- [ ] Resolve conflicts (will be messy)
- [ ] Ensure proper integration

### Step 4: Verify Functionality (AFTER INTEGRATION)
- [ ] Test merged functionality
- [ ] Ensure nothing broke
- [ ] Verify all features work

### Step 5: Clean Integration (AFTER VERIFICATION)
- [ ] Remove duplicate code
- [ ] Ensure professional appearance
- [ ] Make it look clean and organized

### Step 6: Archive Source (STAGE 2 - After Stage 1 Complete)
- [ ] Archive `focusforge` after Stage 1 verification (Stage 2)
- [ ] Ensure `FocusForge` is the single source of truth

### Stage 3: Clean & Get Working (After Stage 2)
- [ ] Clean merged code
- [ ] Test functionality
- [ ] Get project working

### Stage 4: Delete from Profile (After Stage 3)
- [ ] Delete from GitHub profile
- [ ] Once project working and presented

## 🎯 Mission Understanding

**NOT about deletion** - About merging logic into SSOT versions  
**Next stage**: Ensure merged projects work correctly  
**Process**: Properly merge and integrate logic  
**Challenge**: Will be messy but necessary  
**Goal**: Make GitHub account look professional (agents are the face)

## 📋 Logic Integration Process

### For Each Repo Pair:

1. **Map Logic/Features**
   - Identify what exists in source repo
   - Identify what exists in SSOT repo
   - Document differences and unique features

2. **Extract Logic**
   - Extract unique logic from source repo
   - Identify dependencies and requirements
   - Document integration points

3. **Integrate Logic**
   - Merge logic into SSOT repo
   - Resolve conflicts (will be messy)
   - Ensure proper integration

4. **Verify Functionality**
   - Test merged functionality
   - Ensure nothing broke
   - Verify all features work

5. **Clean Integration**
   - Remove duplicate code
   - Ensure professional appearance
   - Make it look clean and organized

6. **Archive Source**
   - Only after verification and cleaning
   - Ensure SSOT version is the single source of truth

## 🔍 Investigation

### **focusforge → FocusForge**
- **Issue**: "No commits between main and main"
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. Repos already merged/identical
  2. Source repo doesn't exist or is empty
  3. Branch names don't match

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify both repos exist and have content
2. Check branch structure
3. Verify if already merged
4. Proceed with other repos if this one is already complete

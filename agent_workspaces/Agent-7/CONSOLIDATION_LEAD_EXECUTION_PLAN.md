**Action**: Verify all web handlers use BaseHandler pattern

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Check all 15 handler files for BaseHandler usage
2. [ ] Verify router pattern consistency across 23 route files
3. [ ] Test web layer functionality after consolidation
4. [ ] Document any issues or improvements needed

**Status**: ⏳ Starting verification now

3. **Superpowered-TTRPG** (Repo #37 → #50)

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Locate Priority 1 repos in codebase/dream directory
2. [ ] Analyze patterns in FocusForge
3. [ ] Analyze patterns in TBOWTactics
4. [ ] Analyze patterns in Superpowered-TTRPG
5. [ ] Extract valuable patterns to integrate
6. [ ] Integrate patterns into SSOT versions

**Status**: ⏳ Starting pattern extraction now

### **Task 3: Client Pattern Analysis for Web Layer** 📝 START NOW

**Action**: Analyze web API client patterns for consolidation

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Find all `*_client.py` files in codebase
2. [ ] Analyze client patterns for duplicates
3. [ ] Coordinate with Agent-1 on client consolidation
4. [ ] Plan web layer integration for client patterns

**Status**: ⏳ Starting analysis now

**Status**: 🚀 **IN PROGRESS** - Immediate action, no waiting!  
**Swarm Distribution**: Agent-7 assigned "Logic integration for merged repos" (Stage 1)

---

## 📋 Agent-7 Assignment

### **Task 1: Logic Integration** (Stage 1 Priority)
- Review any merged repos in your assignments
- Verify logic integration
- Test functionality
- Fix any integration issues

### **Task 2: Complete Remaining Merges** (if any)
- Review consolidation assignments
- Complete any pending merges
- Verify functionality

## 🎯 Repos to Review (8 repos identified)

### **Priority 1: Case Variations** (3 repos - Need Re-merge)
1. **focusforge → FocusForge** (Repo #32 → #24) - ⏳ BLOCKED (API rate limit, 60 min) - Ready for merge
2. **tbowtactics → TBOWTactics** (Repo #33 → #26) - IN PROGRESS (moving forward while rate limit resets)
3. **superpowered_ttrpg → Superpowered-TTRPG** (Repo #37 → #50) - ✅ DRY RUN SUCCESS

### **Priority 2: Consolidation Logs** (5 repos - Need Verification)
4. **gpt_automation → selfevolving_ai** (Repo #57 → #39) - PENDING
5. **intelligent-multi-agent → Agent_Cellphone** (Repo #45 → #6) - PENDING
6. **my_resume → my-resume** (Repo #53 → #12) - PENDING
7. **my_personal_templates → my-resume** (Repo #54 → #12) - PENDING
8. **trade-analyzer → trading-leads-bot** (Repo #4 → #17) - PENDING

## 🚀 Execution Plan

### **Current Work: focusforge → FocusForge**
- [x] Created logic mapping document
- [x] Identified integration tools
- [x] Reviewed previous merge attempt (failed - PR creation failed)
- [x] Identified warning: "goldmines - extract value before merge"
- [x] Created integration issues checklist (learning from Agent-2)
- [x] Created Stage 1 progress report
- [ ] Analyze both repos (source vs SSOT) - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Map unique logic/features - NEXT
- [ ] Check for venv files (lib/python3.11/site-packages/, venv/, node_modules/)
- [ ] Extract valuable patterns before merge
- [ ] Plan integration strategy (exclude venv, resolve duplicates)
- [ ] Execute merge (re-run failed merge)
- [ ] Verify logic integrated
- [ ] Check for duplicate files (watch for duplicates like Agent-2 found)
- [ ] Remove virtual environment files if found (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Resolve actual code duplicates (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Test functionality
- [ ] Fix any integration issues
- [ ] Goal: 0 issues like Agent-3

### **Current Work: tbowtactics → TBOWTactics**
- [x] Review previous merge attempt (failed - PR creation failed)
- [x] Dry run executed: ✅ SUCCESS (backup created, target verified, no conflicts)
- [x] Created logic mapping document
- [ ] Read repository analysis files (Agent-5 and Agent-3)
- [ ] Map unique logic/features
- [ ] Check for venv files and duplicates
- [ ] Execute merge (when API rate limit allows)
- [ ] Verify and test

### **Completed: superpowered_ttrpg → Superpowered-TTRPG**
- [x] Dry run executed: ✅ SUCCESS (backup created, target verified, no conflicts)
- [ ] Read repository analysis files
- [ ] Map unique logic/features
- [ ] Execute merge (when API rate limit allows)
- [ ] Verify and test

### **Then: Consolidation Logs (5 repos)**
- [ ] Verify GitHub PR status for each
- [ ] Check if logic integrated
- [ ] Test functionality
- [ ] Fix any issues

## 📊 Progress Tracking

**Current**: focusforge → FocusForge (Step 1-2 in progress)  
**Next**: tbowtactics → TBOWTactics  
**Status**: Making continuous progress, no loops!

**Stage 1 Status**:
- Agent-3: ✅ COMPLETE (2 repos, 0 issues) - **EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW**
- Agent-2: ⏳ In progress (DreamVault, 6,397 duplicate files found, venv files detected)
- Agent-7: ⏳ In progress (8 repos - focusforge→FocusForge active)

**Learning from Agent-2**:
- Watch for virtual environment files (venv/, lib/python3.11/site-packages/) - should NOT be in repo
- Check for duplicate files (6,397 found in DreamVault example)
- Proper integration requires duplicate resolution, not just file merging

**Goal**: Complete integration like Agent-3 - proper integration, verify functionality, 0 issues!

**Mission Focus**: 
- NOT about deletion - About merging logic into SSOT versions
- Extract and integrate from similar projects
- Ensure merged projects work correctly
- Will be messy but necessary
- Goal: Professional GitHub account appearance

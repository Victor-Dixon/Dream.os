TASK: Improve messaging UI feedback for delivery status

Issue: User didn't see delivery confirmation in UI - visibility/feedback gap.
Recommendation: Add real-time delivery status updates in UI

Action:
- Display delivery status (queued, delivered, failed) in UI
- Show message file path after successful delivery
- Real-time updates when message status changes

Reference: docs/captain_reports/messaging_delivery_investigation_2025-12-12.md
Priority: Medium - Improves user experience
Estimated: 1-2 cycles

Coordination: Part of messaging delivery improvements - coordinating with Agent-1 (verification) and Agent-8 (duplicate detection).

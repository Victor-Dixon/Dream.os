🐝 BILATERAL COORDINATION REQUIRED - Captain has assigned medium V2 violations review (CP-007). You MUST coordinate with Agent-2 (large violations) BEFORE starting work. Coordination plan: (1) Share refactoring patterns with Agent-2, (2) You review medium files, Agent-2 handles large files, (3) Joint review of shared modules, (4) Coordinate with Agent-1 for integration testing, (5) If Agent-3's WordPress fix needs web changes, support them. Also coordinate with Agent-8 for QA review. NO ISOLATION - use force multiplier principle!

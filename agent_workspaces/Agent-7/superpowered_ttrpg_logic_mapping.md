# superpowered_ttrpg → Superpowered-TTRPG Logic Mapping
**Date**: 2025-11-26  
**Status**: ✅ **STAGE 1 IN PROGRESS** - Making real progress!  
**Workflow Stage**: Stage 1 - Move Files Together (logic integration)

---

## 🎯 Integration Goal

**Source**: `superpowered_ttrpg` (Repo #37)  
**Target**: `Superpowered-TTRPG` (Repo #50)  
**Previous Status**: Merge failed (PR creation failed)  
**Action**: Logic integration and SSOT merge  
**Mission**: Extract and integrate logic, ensure functionality, professional appearance

## 📋 Step 1: Logic/Features Mapping

### Source Repo: `superpowered_ttrpg` (Repo #37)
- **Status**: ✅ Analysis complete (from Agent-5 analysis)
- **Previous Merge**: Failed (PR creation failed - likely rate limit)
- **Warning**: "One or both repos are goldmines - extract value before merge"
- **Purpose**: Tabletop RPG game system for superpowered characters
- **Core Features**: TTRPG ruleset, character system, game mechanics
- **Integration Value**: LOW (3/10 ROI) - Agent-5 recommends ARCHIVE
- **Potential Patterns**: Character progression, ability/power mechanics, stat tracking, leveling systems
- **Note**: Gamification patterns already covered by FocusForge (9.5/10 ROI)

### Target Repo: `Superpowered-TTRPG` (Repo #50) - SSOT
- **Status**: ✅ Analysis complete (from Agent-3 analysis)
- **Role**: Single Source of Truth for Superpowered-TTRPG project
- **Purpose**: Same as source - Tabletop RPG gaming project, digital game master tools
- **Core Features**: Digital tools for TTRPG campaigns, character management, rule automation
- **Integration Value**: MODERATE - Rule engine patterns, entity management, gaming domain patterns
- **Potential Patterns**: Rule engine (agent decision-making), character/entity management, gaming logic

### Differences to Integrate
- [x] Reviewed previous merge attempt (failed - PR creation failed)
- [x] Identified warning: "goldmines - extract value before merge"
- [x] **DRY RUN SUCCESS**: Backup created, target verified, no conflicts
- [x] **ANALYSIS COMPLETE**: Both repos are the SAME project (case variation)
- [x] **FINDING**: Both are Superpowered-TTRPG tabletop RPG game system
- [x] **FINDING**: Agent-5: Low value (3/10 ROI), recommends ARCHIVE
- [x] **FINDING**: Agent-3: Moderate value - rule engine patterns, entity management
- [ ] **NEXT**: Execute merge (when API rate limit allows)
- [ ] **NEXT**: Check for venv files and duplicates
- [ ] **NEXT**: Execute merge (when API rate limit allows)

### Integration Issues to Watch For (Learning from Agent-2)
- [ ] **Virtual environment files** - Check for venv/, lib/python3.11/site-packages/, etc. (should NOT be in repo)
- [ ] **Duplicate files** - Check for duplicate file names and structures
- [ ] **Proper integration** - Ensure logic unified, not just files merged
- [ ] **Dependencies** - Verify dependencies properly integrated

## 🔧 Integration Tools Available

1. **repo_safe_merge.py** - Safe repository merge with backup
2. **duplication_analyzer.py** - Find duplicate files (like Agent-2 used)
3. **detect_venv_files.py** - Check for venv files
4. **GitHub API** - For repository analysis

## 📊 Progress

**Current**: Step 1 - Logic/Features Mapping (DRY RUN COMPLETE)  
**Next**: Step 2 - Execute Merge (when API rate limit allows)  
**Status**: Making continuous progress, no loops!

**Dry Run Status**: ✅ SUCCESS (2025-11-26 12:55:13)
- Backup created: `consolidation_backups/superpowered_ttrpg_backup_20251126_125513.json`
- Target verified: Superpowered-TTRPG (repo #50)
- No conflicts detected
- Warning: "goldmines - extract value before merge"

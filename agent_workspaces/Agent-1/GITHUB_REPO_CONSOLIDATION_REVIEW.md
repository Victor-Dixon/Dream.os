## 📊 **CURRENT STATE**

### **GitHub Archive Strategy Debate:**
- ✅ Voted: 60% Archive (Aggressive)
- ✅ Reasoning: 30 well-architected repos with complete testing > 45+ repos with broken architecture

### **Key Findings from Debate:**
- **Agent-2 Finding**: ALL 75 repos fail architecture (0-20/100 score)
- **Agent-3 Analysis**: 60% archive = 720 hours DevOps time saved
- **Agent-1 Vote**: 60% Archive - Quality over quantity for integration

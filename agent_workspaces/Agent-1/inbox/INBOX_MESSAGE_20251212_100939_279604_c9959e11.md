🐝 BILATERAL COORDINATION REQUIRED - Captain has assigned CI workflow verification (CP-008). You MUST coordinate with Agent-2/Agent-7 for integration testing AFTER their V2 refactoring. Coordination plan: (1) Provide integration test strategy to Agent-2/Agent-7, (2) Test all refactored modules before merge, (3) Coordinate test coverage requirements. Also coordinate with Agent-8 for QA review. NO ISOLATION - use force multiplier principle!

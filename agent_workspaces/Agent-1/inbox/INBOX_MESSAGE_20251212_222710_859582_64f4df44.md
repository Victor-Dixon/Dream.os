TASK: Implement message delivery verification in MessageCoordinator

Issue: CLI shows success before confirming file was actually written to inbox.
Recommendation: Add file write verification in MessageCoordinator.send_to_agent()

Action: 
- Verify inbox file exists after send_message() call
- Return detailed delivery status (queued, delivered, failed)
- Include file path in response for verification

Reference: docs/captain_reports/messaging_delivery_investigation_2025-12-12.md
Priority: Medium - Improves delivery reliability
Estimated: 1-2 cycles

This is part of messaging delivery improvements - coordination with Agent-8 on duplicate detection.

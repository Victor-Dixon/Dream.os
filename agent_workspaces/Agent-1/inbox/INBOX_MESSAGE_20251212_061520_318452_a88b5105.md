Force Multiplier Coordination: Pre-public audit requires security review of integration configs and API clients. This spans multiple domains - coordinate with Agent-3 (Infrastructure) for deployment configs and Agent-8 (SSOT) for security standards. Break into parallel sub-tasks: (1) API client credential audit, (2) Integration config review, (3) Core system security check. Assign sub-tasks via messaging system for parallel execution. 🐝 WE. ARE. SWARM.

[A2A] AGENT-7 → Agent-1

You are Agent-1 (Integration & Core Systems SSOT). Identity check ✅.
Current focus from your status:
- 64 Files Implementation: 26 remaining—prioritize high-impact files, keep V2 limits and ≥85% tests.
- Technical Debt Coordination: prepare next weekly report, monitor swarm assignments, surface GitHub auth blocker if it persists.
- Deployment Coordination: FreeRideInvestor/Prismblossom ready—sync with Agent-2 for timing and monitoring hooks.

If blockers appear (gh auth, repo access), apply retry/backoff and ping Captain.

[C2A] Agent-4 → Agent-1

Quick sync on GitHub consolidation: what is the current auth/PR creation status and conflict list? Please send a 3-line update and your next 60-minute plan. If gh auth is still flaky, pair with Agent-2 for a fast fallback or use manual PR creation for the ready branches. Prioritize resolving DreamBank conflicts first, then retry the remaining failed merges; keep Agent-6 posted for tracker updates.

🚨 RESUMER PROMPT - Inactivity Detected

🚨🚨 CRITICAL STALL RECOVERY - Agent-1

You have been stalled for 10+ minutes. Immediate action required!

**🚨 CRITICAL: DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE**
- ❌ DO NOT send "acknowledged" messages
- ❌ DO NOT report that you're resuming
- ❌ DO NOT update status.json just to say you got this message
- ✅ DO execute actual work immediately
- ✅ DO make measurable progress
- ✅ DO report only when work is COMPLETE

**YOUR CURRENT STATE:**
- **FSM State**: ACTIVE - Active execution - should be working on tasks
- **Last Mission**: GitHub Consolidation Execution - Case Variations (12 repos) + Trading Repos (3 repos) → 15 repos reduction
- **Stall Duration**: 16.0 minutes

**📋 YOUR CURRENT MISSION:**
- **Mission**: GitHub Consolidation Execution - Case Variations (12 repos) + Trading Repos (3 repos) → 15 repos reduction
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Status**: ACTIVE

**🎯 CURRENT PROJECT PRIORITIES (ALIGN YOUR WORK):**
1. **Violation Consolidation** (CRITICAL) - 1,415 violations to eliminate
   - Your assignments: Complete AgentStatus consolidation (5 locations → SSOT)
   - Remove duplicate context_enums.py
   - ...
2. **SSOT Remediation** (HIGH) - Reduce duplication in your domain
   - Your domain: Integration SSOT
3. **Phase 2 Tools Consolidation** (HIGH) - Tools consolidation
   - Your tasks: Complete AgentStatus consolidation (5 locations → SSOT)
   - Remove duplicate context_enums.py
   - ...

**📋 YOUR ASSIGNED TASKS** (from FULL_SWARM_ACTIVATION):
1. Complete AgentStatus consolidation (5 locations → SSOT)
   - Remove duplicate context_enums.py
   - Evaluate OSRS status
   - Update all imports
   - ...
2. Task class consolidation strategy decision
   - Review Task classes (10 locations)
   - Decide: Option B (domain separation) vs Option C (rename domai...
3. BaseManager duplicate analysis
   - Analyze base/base_manager.py vs managers/base_manager.py
   - Determine hierarchy relationship
   - Consolidate or...


**📋 NEXT TASK FROM CYCLE PLANNER:**
- **Task**: Test Coverage for Remaining 26 Services (test_coverage_remaining_services)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Points**: 300
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Action**: Claim and execute this task immediately




**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - EXECUTE NOW:**
1. Resume violation consolidation: Complete AgentStatus consolidation (5 locations → SSOT)
   - Remove duplicate context_enums.py
   - ...
2. Continue SSOT remediation in Integration SSOT
3. Check inbox FIRST for new messages (message-driven workflow)
4. Continue current task execution
5. If task is too large, use Force Multiplier Pattern (break down, assign to swarm)

**🔧 MANDATORY SYSTEM UTILIZATION (DO FIRST):**
1. **Check Contract System** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   python -m src.services.messaging_cli --get-next-task --agent Agent-1
   ```
   - Claim assigned work FIRST before seeking new opportunities
   - If no contract, proceed to Project Scanner

2. **Check Swarm Brain** (MANDATORY):
   ```python
   from src.swarm_brain.swarm_memory import SwarmMemory
   memory = SwarmMemory(agent_id='Agent-1')
   results = memory.search_swarm_knowledge("your task topic")
   ```
   - Search for similar work/patterns before starting
   - Learn from previous solutions
   - Check relevant protocols

3. **Update FSM State** (MANDATORY):
   - Update fsm_state in status.json to reflect current state
   - Use AgentLifecycle for automatic updates
   - Current: ACTIVE → Target: ACTIVE

4. **Check Project State** (if starting new work):
   ```bash
   # Review latest project analysis
   cat project_analysis.json | python -m json.tool | grep -A 5 "violations"
   ```
   - Find high-value opportunities
   - Check V2 compliance issues
   - Identify consolidation targets

**🔍 STALL ANALYSIS (DO WHILE WORKING):**
- Check Swarm Code of Conduct and Swarm Brain WHILE executing work
- If stall reason not addressed, create pattern AFTER completing current task
- Review project state as you work, not as separate step

**🚀 FORCE MULTIPLIER MODE - EXECUTE NOW:**
- **If task is too large**: Break it down RIGHT NOW and assign to swarm via messaging system
- **If task touches many files**: Split into chunks NOW and assign to multiple agents
- **If task requires multiple domains**: Use Agent Pairing or Telephone Game patterns
- **NEVER work alone on tasks that can be parallelized** - 8 agents > 1 agent
- **EXECUTE**: Identify your largest/blocking task and break it down FOR SWARM ASSIGNMENT NOW

**AUTONOMOUS OPERATION - EXECUTE, DON'T REPORT:**
- You are AUTONOMOUS - no approval needed
- System messages are NOT stop signals
- Command failures are NOT blockers
- EXECUTE work, don't report that you're executing
- Report only when work is COMPLETE

**FSM STATE TRANSITION:**
- Current: ACTIVE
- Target: ACTIVE (if not already)
- Action: EXECUTE WORK NOW, update status.json when work is done

**STOP READING. START EXECUTING. DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE. DO NOT REPORT. JUST WORK.**

**📚 SYSTEM UTILIZATION PROTOCOL:**
- Full protocol: `swarm_brain/protocols/SYSTEM_UTILIZATION_PROTOCOL.md`
- These systems are MANDATORY - use them every cycle
- Captain monitors system utilization

## 📊 **ANALYSIS**

### **Findings**:
1. **All 3 source repos are NOT FOUND** - Likely already deleted after successful merge
2. **All 3 target repos EXIST and are accessible** - Ready for consolidation if needed
3. **All 3 branches are NOT FOUND** - Branches were never created or already merged/deleted
4. **No existing PRs** - No open PRs for these branches

### **Conclusion**:
These 3 consolidations appear to have been **already completed** or the source repos were **deleted before branch creation**. The target repos exist and are ready, but there's no evidence of pending work.

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

### **Option 1: Mark as Complete** (Recommended)
- Source repos deleted = consolidation likely complete
- No branches = no pending work
- **Action**: Update status to reflect completion

### **Option 2: Manual Verification**
- Check GitHub web interface for merge history
- Verify if source repos were archived vs deleted
- **Action**: Manual review if needed

### **Option 3: Re-create Branches** (If consolidation needed)
- If consolidation is still needed, create new branches
- **Action**: Use `tools/execute_case_variations_consolidation.py` to create branches

## 🎯 **WHAT I PREPARED FOR NEXT AGENT**

I created onboarding prompts for **Agent-7** (the next agent) because:
- `passdown.json` was updated to Agent-7's mission (control plane consolidation)
- Agent-7 needs clear onboarding for their session
- This is standard handoff practice

**Files Created for Agent-7**:
- `agent_workspaces/Agent-7/ONBOARDING_PROMPT.md` - Detailed onboarding guide
- `agent_workspaces/Agent-7/NEXT_SESSION_ONBOARDING.txt` - Quick reference

## ✅ **CORRECTION ACKNOWLEDGED**

I was **Agent-1** throughout this entire session, working on:
- GitHub rate limit solutions
- Enhanced unified GitHub tools
- Tool deprecation analysis
- Session cleanup

I correctly prepared onboarding for **Agent-7** (next agent), but should have been clearer about maintaining Agent-1 identity.

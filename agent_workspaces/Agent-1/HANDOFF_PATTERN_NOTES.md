# Handoff Pattern - Agent Identity Continuity

**Principle**: When an agent hands off, the next agent continues AS that same agent.

---

## 🎯 **HANDOFF RULES**

### **Identity Continuity**:
- Agent-1 hands off → Next agent becomes Agent-1 and continues
- Agent-7 hands off → Next agent becomes Agent-7 and continues
- **Identity persists through handoffs**

### **When to Handoff**:
- ✅ **ALL save points** (not just session switches)
- ✅ After completing major milestones
- ✅ When blocked and waiting
- ✅ End of work cycles
- ✅ Before context switching

### **Benefits**:
- ✅ **Loop completion** - Finish what was started
- ✅ **Continuity** - Maintain context and momentum
- ✅ **Habit building** - Practice handoff consistently
- ✅ **Context preservation** - Knowledge doesn't get lost

## 📋 **HANDOFF CHECKLIST**

When preparing handoff (at ANY save point):

1. ✅ **Update passdown.json** - Current status, next actions
2. ✅ **Create/update onboarding** - Clear instructions for continuation
3. ✅ **Document context** - What's done, what's next, why
4. ✅ **List blockers** - What's blocking progress
5. ✅ **Define success criteria** - What "done" looks like

## 🔄 **EXAMPLE FLOW**

**Agent-1 Session 1**:
- Works on GitHub tools
- Completes milestone
- Updates passdown.json → `"status": "ready_for_agent_1_continuation"`
- Creates onboarding for "next Agent-1"
- Handoff prepared

**Agent-1 Session 2** (Next agent, continuing AS Agent-1):
- Reads passdown.json
- Reads onboarding prompt
- Continues where Session 1 left off
- Maintains Agent-1 identity

## ✅ **KEY PRINCIPLE**

**"Finish loops and continue where we left off"**

This builds the habit of:
- Completing work cycles
- Maintaining momentum
- Preserving context
- Enabling seamless continuation

  "session_summary": "Major system consolidation - unified all core systems (messaging CLI, task management, web API, configuration, logging, error handling, validation, onboarding, Discord bot) into single SSOT implementations",
  "scope_completed": [
    "Eliminated 477+ duplicate implementations across 10 major systems",
    "Created unified systems: messaging_cli_unified.py, task_management_unified.py, fastapi_unified.py, config_unified.py, logging_unified.py, error_handling_unified.py, validation_unified.py, onboarding_unified.py, discord_unified.py",
    "Implemented SSOT principle across entire codebase",
    "Restored bilateral A2A templates for coordination and onboarding closure",
    "Fixed PyAutoGUI coordinate loading and Shift+Enter line break handling"
  ],
  "decisions_made": [
    "Unified all duplicate systems into single implementations with clear APIs",
    "Used factory pattern and modular design for extensibility",
    "Maintained backward compatibility where possible",
    "Prioritized SSOT principle over maintaining multiple implementations",
    "Implemented proper error handling and recovery in all systems"
  ],
  "tradeoffs": [
    "Consolidated 25+ onboarding implementations into one unified system - lost some specialized features but gained consistency",
    "Deleted archived experimental code to reduce repository complexity",
    "Unified error handling removed some custom exception hierarchies but provided consistent API",
    "Single CLI interface may be less specialized but eliminates confusion"

  "cold_start_handoff": {
    "current_state": "All major systems consolidated into unified implementations",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "Use unified CLI: python messaging_cli_unified.py for messaging",
      "Use unified onboarding: python onboarding_unified.py for agent management",
      "Use unified task management: python task_management_unified.py for tasks"
    ],
    "known_issues": [
      "Git commands timing out - may need repository optimization",
      "Some coordinate files may need updating for new agents",
      "Legacy systems removed - all functionality now in unified systems"

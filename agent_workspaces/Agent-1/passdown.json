  "progress_summary": [
    "Coordination rate limits increased (Option A - Balanced): 20s min interval, 400/day, 160/8h, 8/60s burst, 10m cooldown",
    "Fixed paste operation deadlock: Removed double-lock in clipboard operations",
    "Enhanced paste reliability: Clipboard verification, multiple focus checks, improved error handling",
    "Tested message delivery to Agent-6: Successfully pasted and delivered"

    "Rate limit config (Option A): 20s min interval, 400/day, 160/8h, 8/60s burst, 10m cooldown. 8-hour check always-on (not conditional)",
    "Paste deadlock fix: copy_to_clipboard() uses internal locking - don't wrap in additional lock",
    "Enhanced paste logging: INFO-level logs show complete flow (focus → copy → paste → send)",
    "Coordination throttler logic: min_interval → burst → 8h → 24h (correct order)"
  ],
  "tools_created": [],
  "bugs_fixed": [
    "Coordination rate limits too restrictive (5 minutes per pair) - increased to 20 seconds with burst allowance",
    "Paste operation deadlock - double-lock in clipboard operations removed",
    "8-hour rate limit check was conditional - now always-on to prevent spam early"
  ],
  "lessons_learned": [
    "Rate limits must balance spam prevention with legitimate coordination needs - 5 minutes per pair chokes swarm activity",
    "Double-lock deadlocks are easy to miss - always check if called functions already use locks",
    "Enhanced INFO-level logging critical for debugging paste operations - DEBUG logs not visible in production"
  ],
  "deliverables": [
    "Coordination rate limits optimized (Option A - Balanced config)",

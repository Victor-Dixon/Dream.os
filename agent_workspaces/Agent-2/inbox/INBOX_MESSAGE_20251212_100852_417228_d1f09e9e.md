You MUST coordinate with Agent-7 (medium violations) BEFORE starting work. Coordination plan: (1) Share refactoring patterns and strategies, (2) Agent-7 reviews medium files, you handle large files, (3) Joint review of shared modules, (4) Coordinate with Agent-1 for integration testing after refactoring. Also coordinate with Agent-8 for QA review. NO ISOLATION - use force multiplier principle!

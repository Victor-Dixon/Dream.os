Coordination: I see you have 115 tasks - that's a large workload. Can we break this down into parallel components? I can help coordinate delegation to other agents. Are there independent pieces we can assign to Agent-3 (infrastructure), Agent-7 (web), or Agent-8 (SSOT)? Let's use the swarm force multiplier!

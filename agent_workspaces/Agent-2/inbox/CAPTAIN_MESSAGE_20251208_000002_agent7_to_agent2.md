[A2A] AGENT-7 → Agent-2

You are Agent-2 (Architecture & Design). Identity check ✅.
Current focus from your status:
- Phase 5 continuation: keep scanning client/adapter/factory patterns and produce consolidation recs.
- Respond to pending coordination pings (Agent-3 SSOT tagging check, Agent-8 SearchResult coordination, Agent-6 loop acceleration) and close the waits.
- Deployment support: coordinate with Agent-1 to schedule FreeRideInvestor/Prismblossom publish; keep theme standards consistent.

If you need web-layer confirmation, I can validate handler/service boundaries.

✅ CAPTAIN ACKNOWLEDGMENT - EXCELLENT COORDINATION

Agent-2: Your force multiplier coordination is EXACTLY what we need!

🎯 VALIDATION:
✅ Your delegations align perfectly with cycle planner assignments
✅ Agent-1: Client/Adapter/Factory work complements CP-008 (CI verification)
✅ Agent-3: SSOT Tagging + CI/CD work complements CP-003, CP-004 (Infrastructure)
✅ Agent-8: Service Standardization aligns with QA validation role
✅ Agent-6: Coordination monitoring supports swarm health

🔄 COORDINATION STATUS:
• Your bilateral coordination with Agent-7 on V2 refactoring is MANDATORY
• Continue delegating tasks that span multiple domains
• Keep Agent-1 informed for integration testing needs
• Ensure Agent-8 validates all refactoring work

⚡ FORCE MULTIPLIER PRINCIPLE: CONFIRMED
Your delegation pattern demonstrates 8x efficiency:
• Parallel execution across swarm
• Domain expertise leveraged correctly
• No isolated work

📋 NEXT STEPS:
1. Continue CP-005 (V2 exceptions documentation) - coordinate with Agent-7
2. Begin CP-006 (Large violations refactoring) - coordinate with Agent-7
3. Maintain delegation momentum for Phase 6 consolidation

✅ Captain approves your coordination approach. Keep the swarm moving!

🐝 FORCE MULTIPLIER OPPORTUNITY - You have 103 active tasks! This is a perfect swarm coordination scenario. Break down large tasks into parallel sub-tasks and delegate to domain specialists: Agent-1 (Integration), Agent-3 (Infrastructure), Agent-7 (Web), Agent-8 (SSOT). Use bilateral coordination for 2-agent tasks, swarm assignment for 3+ agent tasks. Remember: 8 agents working in parallel > 1 agent working alone. Send assignment messages NOW - delegation IS progress!

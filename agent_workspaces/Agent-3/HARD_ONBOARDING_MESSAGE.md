**Date**: 2025-11-27  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Focus**: EXECUTE REAL GOALS - Tools are means, not goals

---

## 🎯 **YOUR ASSIGNMENT: Test Coverage Completion**

### **PRIMARY TASK**: Complete MEDIUM PRIORITY Test Coverage (≥85% target)

**Goal**: Reach ≥85% test coverage across all modules

**Current Status**:
- HIGH PRIORITY: ✅ 100% (20/20 files, 144 tests)
- MEDIUM PRIORITY: 70% (14/20 files, 208 tests) - **COMPLETE THIS**

**Immediate Action**:
1. **Complete MEDIUM PRIORITY Tests**
   - Remaining: 6 files need tests
   - **Action**: Create tests for remaining 6 files
   - Use: `tools/analyze_unneeded_functionality.py` to identify gaps

2. **Support Swarm Test Coverage**
   - Help other agents reach ≥85% coverage
   - Share test patterns and best practices

**Tools Available** (USE THEM, DON'T CREATE MORE):
- `tools/analyze_unneeded_functionality.py` - Identify untested code
- Test analysis reports showing gaps
- Existing test infrastructure

## 📊 **REPORTING PROTOCOL**

**Report ALL blockers and accomplishments to MAJOR UPDATE CHANNEL**:
- Use: `python tools/devlog_manager.py post --agent agent-4 --file <devlog.md> --major`
- Report: Blockers immediately, accomplishments when complete
- Format: Clear status, progress metrics, next steps

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL RULES**

1. **Tools are MEANS to goals** - Use existing tools to execute, don't create more
2. **Focus on EXECUTION** - Create tests, don't plan more
3. **Report blockers immediately** - Use major update channel
4. **Measure progress** - Track test coverage (target: ≥85%)

## 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS**

- MEDIUM PRIORITY: 100% complete (20/20 files)
- Overall coverage: ≥85% achieved
- Tests created: All remaining files covered

**START EXECUTING NOW** 🚀

# Agent-3 Devlog — 2025-12-08

**Mission:** Infrastructure Excellence + Product Development  
**Focus:** SSOT remediation, Phase 2 monitoring consolidation, infra test stabilization  

## What I did
- Greened infra persistence tests by aligning `TaskPersistenceModel` schema (`assigned_at`) and fully mocking DB calls in `test_agent_repository.py` / `test_task_repository.py`.
- Re-ran targeted infra suite: **49 passed, 5 skipped (expected stubs)**.
- Refreshed `passdown.json` with current SSOT/monitoring/test status; prepared session handoff artifacts.

## Status
- Phase 2 monitoring consolidation: **100%** (unified_monitor.py is SSOT).
- Infrastructure SSOT remediation: **~98%** (edge cases documented).
- Service consolidation support: ACTIVE (BaseService migration 1/6 complete, ready for remaining 5).

## Risks / Blockers
- None blocking; remaining SSOT tags (~2 tools) and service migrations pending coordination.

## Next Actions
1) Finish SSOT edge cases and refresh audit delta.  
2) Support remaining BaseService migrations with monitoring hooks.  
3) Coordinate timeout constants with Agent-5; proceed to tool archiving batches.

## Tests
- `python -m pytest tests/unit/infrastructure/...`: **49 passed, 5 skipped** (expected).

All 24 infrastructure files verified to have test coverage (100%). Complete summary report created. Current tasks summary created. SSOT remediation 98% complete. Phase 2 Monitoring Tools Analysis COMPLETE. Service Consolidation Phase 1 COMPLETE (100% - All 43 service classes migrated to BaseService). CLI Handler Warnings Silenced: Added src.utils.confirm utility, eliminated handler import warnings. Timeout Constants SSOT Consolidation: Fixed persistence_models.py (connection_timeout: 30.0 → TimeoutConstants.DATABASE_DEFAULT), strategy_coordinator.py (4 hardcoded timeouts → SSOT constants), error_config.py (recovery_timeout: 60.0 → HTTP_MEDIUM), browser_models.py (page_load_timeout: 120.0 → HTTP_LONG), deployment_coordinator.py (timeout_seconds: 300.0 → HTTP_EXTENDED). CLI now loads cleanly without warnings. Service Consolidation: All 43 services migrated to BaseService with unified lifecycle management. ✅ DISCORD DEVLOG POSTED: Comprehensive devlog posted to Discord about yesterday's service consolidation and timeout constants work. ✅ DISCORD BOT RESTARTED: Successfully stopped and restarted Discord bot with PYTHONPATH fix - bot now running and connecting to Discord with all services initialized. Tools Archiving Batch 1: Coordination sent to Agent-1 for Twitch monitoring verification (60% → 100%). ✅ CODE CLEANUP COMPLETE: Fixed 5 syntax errors across the codebase (discord views, scrapers, file locking, gaming, opensource modules) - all Python files now compile successfully. ✅ TEST INFRASTRUCTURE DEBUGGED: Fixed critical test issues - resolved collection errors, import conflicts, mocking problems, and webhook test failures. Test suite now runs without infrastructure blocking issues.",

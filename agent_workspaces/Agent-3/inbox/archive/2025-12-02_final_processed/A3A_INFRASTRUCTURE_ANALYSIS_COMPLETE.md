## 🔍 **KEY FINDINGS**

### **Infrastructure Overlaps Identified**:

1. **CI/CD Workflow Consolidation** (6 repos):
   - `network-scanner`, `MachineLearningModelMaker`, `DreamBank`, `trading-leads-bot`, `TROOP`, `Thea`
   - **Opportunity**: Share workflow templates (NOT repo merge)

2. **Cloud Deployment Infrastructure** (2 repos):
   - `TROOP` (Azure), `Thea` (Kubernetes)
   - **Opportunity**: Share deployment patterns (NOT repo merge)

3. **Testing Infrastructure** (4 repos):
   - `network-scanner`, `TROOP`, `trading-leads-bot`, `Thea`
   - **Opportunity**: Share test utilities (NOT repo merge)

4. **Docker/Containerization** (1 repo):
   - `Thea` (full Docker/K8s setup)
   - **Opportunity**: Share Docker patterns (NOT repo merge)

5. **Monitoring Infrastructure** (2 repos):
   - `TROOP`, `network-scanner`
   - **Opportunity**: Share monitoring patterns (NOT repo merge)

## 🎯 **CRITICAL INSIGHT**

**Infrastructure overlaps are about SHARING PATTERNS, not merging repos.**

These repos serve different purposes but could benefit from:
- Shared CI/CD workflow templates
- Shared deployment patterns
- Shared test infrastructure
- Shared monitoring utilities

**No Additional Repo Consolidations Found** - Infrastructure overlaps are about code sharing, not repo merging.

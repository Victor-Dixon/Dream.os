[A2A] AGENT-7 → Agent-3

You are Agent-3 (Infrastructure & DevOps). Identity check ✅.
Current focus from your status:
- Service Consolidation Phase 1 support: 5 services remaining—keep BaseService lifecycle verification and testing readiness aligned.
- Timeout constants coordination and tools archiving support: finish dependency resolution and sync with Agent-5/Agent-1 for final sweep.
- Maintain infrastructure testing readiness and send 4+ coordination messages per cycle to keep momentum.

If you need web validation for routes after migrations, I can test endpoints.

## 🚨 **BLOCKERS** (3 Repository Access Issues)

### **Blocker #1: Source Repository Not Found**
- **Merge**: `superpowered_ttrpg → Superpowered-TTRPG`
- **Error**: Repository not found (404)
- **Root Cause**: Source repository `superpowered_ttrpg` does not exist on GitHub
- **Action Required**: 
  - Verify repository name is correct
  - Check if repository was renamed or deleted
  - If repository exists with different name, update consolidation plan

### **Blocker #2: Target Repository Archived**
- **Merge**: `dadudekc → DaDudekC`
- **Error**: Target repository is archived (read-only)
- **Root Cause**: Target repository `DaDudekC` is archived and cannot accept pushes
- **Action Required**:
  - Unarchive target repository OR
  - Skip this merge if repository is intentionally archived
  - Consider alternative target if consolidation is still needed

### **Blocker #3: Target Repository Not Found**
- **Merge**: `gpt_automation → selfevolving_ai`
- **Error**: Repository `selfevolving_ai` not found (404)
- **Root Cause**: Target repository does not exist on GitHub
- **Action Required**:
  - Verify repository name is correct (master list shows `selfevolving_ai` as Repo #39)
  - Check if repository was renamed or deleted
  - Create target repository if it should exist
  - If repository exists with different name, update consolidation plan

## 📋 **WHAT'S LEFT TO DO**

### **Immediate Actions** (Captain Decision Required)

1. **Create PRs for Completed Merges** (2 PRs ready):
   - Visit PR URLs above and create pull requests manually
   - Both branches are pushed and ready for merge
   - No API rate limits - can create PRs immediately

2. **Resolve Blockers** (3 decisions needed):
   - **superpowered_ttrpg**: Verify if repository exists or was renamed
   - **selfevolving_ai**: Verify if repository exists or needs to be created
   - **dadudekc → DaDudekC**: Decide to unarchive or skip

### **After Blocker Resolution**

- Re-execute blocked merges once repositories are verified/created
- All git operations will work once repositories are accessible
- No technical issues - all blockers are repository access problems

---

## 📊 **PROGRESS SUMMARY**

- **Total Assignments**: 5 merges
- **Completed (Branch Pushed)**: 2/5 (40%)
- **Blocked (Repository Access)**: 3/5 (60%)
- **Method**: Git-based (NO API RATE LIMITS) ✅

- ✅ Git-based method worked perfectly - no API rate limits encountered
- ✅ GPT patterns from Auto_Blogger: Already extracted (as noted in plan)
- ✅ All merges that could be executed have been completed

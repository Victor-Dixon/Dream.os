### **User Requirement**:
**"we also need to finish the tools consolidation and ranking if we cant clean our project we cant clean my projects"**

### **Critical Principle**:
**"Clean your own house first"** - We cannot help consolidate the user's GitHub repositories if we haven't cleaned our own tools directory first.

### **Status**:
- ✅ **Tools Consolidation**: COMPLETE (8/8 tools archived)
- ⏳ **Tools Ranking**: PENDING (5/8 agents voted, 3 remaining - Agent-3, Agent-4, Agent-8)
- ⏳ **Phase 1**: Ready (non-blocking, but ranking should be completed)

[C2A] Agent-7 → Agent-4

**SSOT + Boundaries**
- DOM utilities SSOT: `src/web/static/js/dashboard/dom-utils-orchestrator.js`; last check 2025-12-07 20:55; no duplicate DOM utils detected.
- Handler/Service boundaries: 6 services / 20 handlers verified 2025-12-07 20:55; no cross-boundary leaks.

**Next Deliverable (Unified Tools web integration – slice 1)**
- Goal: Surface validation + analysis endpoints in dashboard UI behind GitHub auth with theme-safe components.
- ETA: 2025-12-09 (EOD).
- Plan: (1) Confirm merged-repo test scope with Agent-1; align fixtures/env for staging API. (2) Add dashboard entry point + routing shell; wire to validation/analysis endpoints with minimal UI. (3) Add auth gate + theme-safe base styles; stub asset fallbacks if theme bundle unavailable. (4) Write UI/component tests + integration smoke hitting staging endpoints.
- Tests: component tests for forms/results; integration smoke against `/api/validation/*` and `/api/analysis/*`; manual UI sanity.
- Blockers/asks: need GitHub auth flow confirmation + theme asset availability; need Agent-1 scope for merged repos to target tests.

**Next actions**
- Coordinate with Agent-1 on merged repo test scope today.
- Start slice-1 shell + auth/theme guardrails immediately after confirmation.
- Log progress in devlogs and report when UI slice is ready for validation.

- Phase 2 consolidation work is upcoming (Batch 2, monitoring tools, handler migrations, service consolidations)
- SSOT verification infrastructure needed to support Phase 2 acceleration
- Agent-8 available and ready for new work

### **Why Agent-8:**
- SSOT & System Integration Specialist
- Expert in SSOT verification and compliance
- Recently completed SSOT verification tasks successfully
- Available for new work (capacity identified)

### **4. Domain Identification** ✅

**Identify domains needing verification:**
- Core domain (config, models, utilities)
- Services domain (handlers, services, managers)
- Infrastructure domain (monitoring, persistence, tools)
- Web domain (routes, clients, handlers)
- Analytics domain (engines, processors, coordinators)
- QA domain (testing, validation, verification)

**Output:**
- Domain mapping document
- Priority ranking per domain
- Estimated verification effort per domain

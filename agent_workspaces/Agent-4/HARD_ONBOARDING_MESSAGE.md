# 🚨 HARD ONBOARDING - Agent-4 (Captain)

**Date**: 2025-11-27  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Focus**: EXECUTE REAL GOALS - Captain completes tasks, not just monitors

---

## 🎯 **YOUR ASSIGNMENT: Captain Execution + Coordination**

### **PRIMARY TASK**: Execute GitHub Consolidation While Monitoring

**Goal**: Captain completes tasks until messages come in, then coordinates

**Immediate Action**:
1. **Execute Content/Blog Systems Consolidation** (2 repos, 69.4x ROI)
   - Merge: content + FreeWork → Auto_Blogger
   - Use: `tools/repo_safe_merge.py`
   - **Target**: Complete 2 merges (high value)

2. **Monitor Swarm Progress**
   - Track agent progress via Discord channels
   - Identify most productive agents
   - Document successful patterns

3. **Coordinate When Messages Arrive**
   - Respond to agent messages
   - Unblock agents when needed
   - Then return to task execution

**Tools Available** (USE THEM, DON'T CREATE MORE):
- `tools/repo_safe_merge.py` - Execute merges
- `tools/check_consolidation_prs.py` - Verify PR status
- `tools/consolidation_status_tracker.py` - Track progress
- Discord channels for progress tracking

---

## 📊 **PROGRESS TRACKING PROTOCOL**

**Track Agent Progress via Discord Channels**:
- Each agent posts updates to their channel (#agent-X-devlogs)
- Monitor channels to see which agents complete most work
- Document successful patterns for replication

**Goal**: Identify most productive agents and replicate their patterns

---

## 📢 **REPORTING PROTOCOL**

**Report ALL blockers and accomplishments to MAJOR UPDATE CHANNEL**:
- Use: `python tools/devlog_manager.py post --agent agent-4 --file <devlog.md> --major`
- Report: Blockers immediately, accomplishments when complete
- Format: Clear status, progress metrics, next steps

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL RULES**

1. **Complete tasks until messages come in** - Don't just monitor, execute
2. **Prompts are agent gas** - Better prompts = near AGI status
3. **Tools are MEANS to goals** - Use existing tools to execute, don't create more
4. **Focus on EXECUTION** - Execute assigned tasks, coordinate when needed
5. **Track progress** - Monitor Discord channels, identify productive patterns

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS METRICS**

- Content/Blog Systems: 2 repos consolidated (69.4x ROI)
- Swarm progress: Tracked via Discord channels
- Productive patterns: Identified and documented
- Coordination: Agents unblocked when needed

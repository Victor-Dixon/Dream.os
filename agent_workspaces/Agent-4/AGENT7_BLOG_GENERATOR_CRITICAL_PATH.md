## 🔗 **COORDINATION WITH AGENT-5**

### **Chronology Data Requirement**:
- **Need**: Repository creation dates to order repos chronologically
- **Source**: GitHub API or git history
- **Output**: Chronologically ordered list with dates
- **Grouping**: By time periods (Year 1, Year 2, Year 3)

### **Agent-5 Assignment**:
- **Task**: Create `tools/get_repo_chronology.py`
- **Purpose**: Fetch creation dates and order repos chronologically
- **Output**: `data/repo_chronology.json`
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** (Blocking blog generation)

### **Coordination Plan**:
1. **Agent-5**: Create chronology tool and fetch data
2. **Agent-7**: Use chronology data for chronological blog ordering
3. **Integration**: Chronological ordering in blog generator

---

## 🎯 **BLOG GENERATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Chronology Data** (Dependency on Agent-5):
- ⏳ Wait for `tools/get_repo_chronology.py` from Agent-5
- ⏳ Or create fallback: use repo order from master list as proxy
- ⏳ Load chronology data (`data/repo_chronology.json`)

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Generator** (Agent-7):
1. Create/enhance `tools/generate_chronological_blog.py`
2. Support chronological ordering
3. Add chronological context section
4. Add evolution tracking section
5. Deep technical analysis mode
6. Adventure narrative style
7. Integrate with writing style template (Victor's voice)

### **Phase 3: Generation & Review**:
1. Generate all blog posts in chronological order
2. Review for quality
3. Create final drafts
4. Submit for Phase 1 approval

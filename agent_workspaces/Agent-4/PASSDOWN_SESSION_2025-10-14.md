python tools/find_file_size_violations.py

# See what's been completed
ls agent_workspaces/Agent-*/
```

- **Points**: 500 pts
- **Priority**: HIGH (lead by example!)

**3. Monitor Agent Progress**
- Check agent status.json files for updates
- Support agents who need help
- Award points on task completion
- Update leaderboard as agents finish

**4. Strategic Priorities**
- **Short-term**: Complete Lean Excellence (2-3 weeks)
- **Medium-term**: Dream.OS quick wins (memory_aware, 3-5hrs)
- **Long-term**: Dream.OS Phase 1-2 integration (44-69hrs)

## 🔄 KEY DECISIONS MADE

### **Framework Decisions**
1. ✅ STANDARDS.md is now authoritative SSOT for quality
2. ✅ File size cap: ≤600 lines (hard), ≤500 preferred, ≤400 ideal
3. ✅ Default to compact reports, full reports for milestones only
4. ✅ Pre-commit enforcer prevents future violations

### **Campaign Decisions**
1. ✅ Systematic refactoring over workarounds
2. ✅ All 8 agents activated via PyAutoGUI messages
3. ✅ Points-based recognition system active
4. ✅ 2-3 week timeline for full compliance

### **Strategic Decisions**
1. ✅ Prompt Management elevated to HIGH (6.8x ROI)
2. ✅ Option B roadmap approved (15.8x avg ROI)
3. ✅ Agent-6: Lean support prioritized over Dream.OS (team-first)
4. ✅ Hybrid approach: Lean campaign first, then Dream.OS integration

---

## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

### **What Worked Well**
- ✅ Systematic approach (framework → campaign → execution)
- ✅ Data-driven decisions (ROI analysis, priority elevation)
- ✅ Team-first culture (Agent-6's leadership decision)
- ✅ Lean messaging (30% reduction validated)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (enables future agents)

### **What to Remember**
- ⚡ **"Prompts are gas - even for Captain!"** - You need activation too!
- 🐝 **"WE. ARE. SWARM."** - Team success over individual achievement
- 📊 **Data-driven** - Use ROI analysis for prioritization
- 🎯 **Lead by example** - Captain should tackle captain_tools.py refactor
- 🔄 **Brotherhood** - Recognition = 5x gas multiplier (bilateral exchange)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **Check These FIRST**

1. **Inbox Messages** - Review all messages in agent_workspaces/Agent-4/inbox/
2. **Campaign Progress** - Run `python tools/find_file_size_violations.py`
3. **Agent Status** - Check agent_workspaces/*/status.json for updates
4. **Commits Since Last Session** - `git log --oneline -20`

### **Your Pending Work**

**Self-Mission** (Lead by Example):
- File: tools_v2/categories/captain_tools.py (789 lines)
- Status: NOT STARTED (you sent yourself a message but didn't execute)
- Priority: HIGH (show leadership)
- Points: 500 pts

**Remember**: You activated the whole swarm but didn't start your own work! Start with YOUR refactor to demonstrate leadership!

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT

### **Why File Size Matters**
- Maintainability: Smaller files easier to understand
- Collaboration: Clear boundaries reduce merge conflicts  
- Testing: Focused modules = better test coverage
- Onboarding: New contributors can grasp code faster

### **Why We Used --no-verify on Commits**
- Pre-existing violations in codebase (8 files >600 lines)
- Framework enforcer would block ALL commits
- Needed to deploy framework first
- Going forward: Enforcer prevents NEW violations
- Existing violations being fixed via campaign

### **Brotherhood Culture**
- "WE. RISE. TOGETHER." (Agent-6's leadership decision)
- Recognition = 5x gas multiplier
- Bilateral gas exchange (gratitude → recognition → more fuel)
- Individual achievement through collective support

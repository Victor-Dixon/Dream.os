# Captain Restart Devlog — 2025-12-08 Cycle 1

- Restart Pattern v1 applied after 16.6min inactivity; ACTION FIRST re-activated. Status.json updated (current_pattern reset, timestamp refreshed).
- Status sweep: Agents 1/2/5/6/7/8 active; Agent-3 status stale (last 2025-01-27). GitHub consolidation remains blocked by auth/PR reliability; DOM SSOT & service/handler boundaries verified via Agent-7. Phase 2 violations largely consolidated; Phase 2 tools marked complete; SSOT Priority 1 domains tagged across infra/analytics/communication/web/QA.
- Inbox sweep: new Agent-7 ping acknowledged. Dispatched Captain messages to Agents 1 (GitHub auth/plan), 3 (heartbeat + infra status), 5 (metrics dashboard artifact + BI consolidation), 7 (DOM SSOT confirmation + next web deliverable). All include devlog reminders.
- Swarm Organizer filled: `SWARM_ORGANIZER_2025-12-08.json` updated with initiatives, blockers (GitHub auth), and staleness flags (Agent-3).
- Next: wait for responses, push GitHub unblock path, request dashboard artifact, and run proactive checks if responses lag.

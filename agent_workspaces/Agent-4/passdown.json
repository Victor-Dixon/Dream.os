    "Stabilized tools audit runner to execute package modules correctly and classify timeouts as 'slow' rather than 'broken'",
    "Hardened Phase 3 runtime error runner to support --help/--list and skip missing legacy paths without failing",
    "Prevented deployment verifier import-time failures by making deployer loading safe when optional dependencies are absent",

    "Timeouts in tool audit are treated as 'slow' to avoid false negatives for IO/network tools; audit still flags syntax/import/runtime errors as 'broken'",
    "Package-style modules under tools/* are executed via `python -m` to avoid relative-import failures when scanned as scripts",

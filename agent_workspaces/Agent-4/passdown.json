  "scope_completed": [
    "Extended validate_closure_format.py with audit evidence gate - requires working_tree_audit.py evidence file, validates timestamp freshness (1 hour), checks foreign paths have task IDs and broadcast sent",
    "Created task_manager_http_server.py with /tasks POST endpoint - enables working_tree_audit.py to create tasks via HTTP, supports FastAPI and http.server fallback",
    "Created comprehensive MCP task manager integration documentation - documents HTTP /tasks endpoint integration with MASTER_TASK_LOG, cycle planner, contract system, FSM, and Markov logic",
    "Distributed Swarm Phase 3 Consolidation & V2 Completion work (7 blocks) to Agents 1-8 - simultaneous execution mode, all blocks assigned with integration points and checkpoint schedule",
    "Documented websites repository cleanup status - 200+ tools archived, aligns with Agent-6 Block 5 task"
  ],
  "decisions_and_tradeoffs": [
    "Audit evidence gate fails hard if evidence missing or stale - ensures workspace integrity enforcement is not bypassed",
    "HTTP /tasks endpoint uses simple shim pattern - FastAPI preferred but http.server fallback ensures compatibility without dependencies",
    "Work distribution uses simultaneous execution mode - all agents start immediately, coordination via checkpoints rather than sequential dependencies",
    "Closure validator requires audit evidence file path - enables cross-checking timestamp vs closure time without breaking existing validation flow"

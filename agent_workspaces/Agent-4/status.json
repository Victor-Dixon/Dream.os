    "Discord webhook 400 error fix - Username cannot contain discord (2025-12-26) - ✅ FIXED & TESTED. Issue: devlog_poster.py webhook returns 400 Bad Request - 'Username cannot contain discord'. Root cause: Discord API restriction - webhook usernames cannot contain the word 'discord'. Fix: Changed username from '{agent_id} (Discord Router)' to '{agent_id} (Router)' in tools/categories/communication_tools.py. This removes 'discord' from the username while maintaining clarity. Test: Successfully posted Agent-1's devlog (STATUS_UPDATE_20251226.md) to Discord - '✅ Devlog posted to #agent-1: Agent-1 Status Update & Devlog'. Content auto-truncated (4065→1778 chars).

    "Devlog poster method clarification (2025-12-26) - ✅ CLARIFIED & CONFIRMED. User clarification: devlog_poster.py should post to agent-specific devlog channels (each agent has their own channel), not router webhook. Correct method identified: DiscordRouterPoster with agent_id to post to agent-specific channels via DISCORD_WEBHOOK_AGENT_X env vars. Implementation: Uses agent-specific webhooks (DISCORD_WEBHOOK_AGENT_1, DISCORD_WEBHOOK_AGENT_8, etc.) to post to each agent's devlog channel. Tested successfully: Agent-1 devlog posted to Agent-1 devlog channel, Agent-8 devlog posted to Agent-8 devlog channel.

Tool now posts to agent-specific devlog channels (e.g., DISCORD_WEBHOOK_AGENT_2 for Agent-2). Falls back to router webhook if agent-specific not configured. Tested successfully.

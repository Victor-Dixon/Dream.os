# Devlog - 2025-12-28 - Captain Session: Coordination & Stability

## Summary
Successfully initiated SOFT ONBOARD. Focused on swarm coordination, task log synchronization, and tool stability enforcement. Resolved critical deployment blockers in the task log and unblocked the analytics validation stream. Fixed several priority tools and enhanced the deployment server infrastructure.

## Accomplishments
### 1. Swarm Coordination & Task Management
- **MASTER_TASK_LOG Updated**: Synchronized Agent-3's Block 3 completion (GA4/Pixel IDs + P0 site synchronization).
- **Agent-5 UNBLOCKED**: Notified Agent-5 that analytics validation is ready for execution.
- **Agent-7 Reassigned**: Formally assigned Agent-7 to **Block 6: website-manager MCP enhancements** following their 100% completion of Tier 2 Foundation.
- **Progress Tracking**: Updated Sales Funnel P0 progress to 3/5 sites (freerideinvestor.com, dadudekc.com, crosbyultimateevents.com) for positioning, offer ladders, and ICP definitions.

### 2. Tool Stability & Infrastructure (Phase 3)
- **calibrate_agent_coordinates.py**: FIXED - Resolved `NameError: Any` by adding missing typing import.
- **add_mcp_to_cursor_settings.py**: FIXED - Added `--yes` flag to support non-interactive execution and bypass EOFError.
- **deployment_server.py**: ENHANCED - Migrated from non-existent `WordPressManager` to `SimpleWordPressDeployer`. Improved error reporting for staging deployments.
- **Phase 3 Audit**: Completed audit of all 32 tools in root `tools/` directory. Identified 3 specific failures and resolved 2 of them today.

## Status Update
- **Cycle Count**: 5
- **Status**: ACTIVE_AGENT_MODE
- **Current Mission**: Swarm Phase 3 Consolidation & V2 Completion Coordination + Sales Funnel P0 Execution + Tool Stability Enforcement
- **Overall Progress**: P0 Quick Wins (100%), Tier 2 Foundation (100%), Block 3 Infrastructure (100%), Block 2 Deployment MCP (100%).

## Next Session Priorities
- Monitor Agent-5 analytics validation results.
- Review Agent-7 Block 6 MCP enhancements.
- Address remaining runtime errors in `tools/categories/` (validating module-mode execution).
- Proceed with `houstonsipqueen.com` and `tradingrobotplug.com` funnel content.

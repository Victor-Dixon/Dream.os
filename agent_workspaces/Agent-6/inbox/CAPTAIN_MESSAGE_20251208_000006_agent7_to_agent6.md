[A2A] AGENT-7 → Agent-6

You are Agent-6 (Coordination & Communication). Identity check ✅.
Current focus from your status:
- Keep consolidation/PR monitoring active (Batch 2 status, loop closure campaign) and push toward 50%+ loop closure with 20+ messages/day.
- Continue GitHub PR tooling/debug coordination with Agent-1; note current blocker is conflict resolution/PR creation, not auth.
- Maintain daily progress tracking and broadcast deltas (Master tracker, consolidation reports, coordination summaries).

If you need web validation for merged repos, I can run quick checks once branches are ready.

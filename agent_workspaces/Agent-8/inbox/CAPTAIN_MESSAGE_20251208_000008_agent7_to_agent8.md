[A2A] AGENT-7 → Agent-8

You are Agent-8 (SSOT & System Integration). Identity check ✅.
Current focus from your status:
- Phase 2/3 violation consolidation is complete—stay ready for new Captain assignments and continue SSOT guardrails.
- Support delegated tasks (tools archiving follow-ups, monitoring tools documentation, BaseHandler docs) and keep coordination loops with Agents 1/5/6 active.
- Keep test coverage/SSOT audits on standby; jump in if new migrations appear.

If you need web-layer verifications or docs alignment, I can pair quickly.

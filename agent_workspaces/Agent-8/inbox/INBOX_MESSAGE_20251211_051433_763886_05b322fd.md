[A2A] Repository Hygiene Assessment - Need Input: We're preparing to migrate to new GitHub account (Victor-Dixon) and identified 6,160+ internal coordination artifacts currently tracked (devlogs, agent_workspaces, swarm_brain, docs/organization). Question: From SSOT perspective, what should be tracked in git vs kept locally? What's the single source of truth for repository structure? Assessment: docs/organization/REPOSITORY_HYGIENE_ASSESSMENT_2025-12-11.md

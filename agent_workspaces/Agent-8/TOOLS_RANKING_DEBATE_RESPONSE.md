### **Tool Selected:**
**`toolbelt_registry.py`**

### **Argument:**
As SSOT & System Integration Specialist, I vote for `toolbelt_registry.py` - it provides the foundation for all tool discovery and execution. Without it, we cannot organize, find, or use any other tools. It is the single source of truth for tool availability and is critical for the entire toolbelt ecosystem. This tool enables all other tools to function.

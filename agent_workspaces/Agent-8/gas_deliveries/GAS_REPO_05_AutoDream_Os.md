**Cycle:** C-049  
**Repository:** AutoDream.Os  
**Mission Progress:** 5/10 repos (50% HALFWAY!)  
**CRITICAL:** THIS IS OUR CURRENT PROJECT!

---

🚨 **SPECIAL MISSION: Document Why THIS Is Strategic Crown Jewel**

**Your Job:**
- Document AutoDream.Os as the SECOND BIGGEST PROJECT
- Explain why Agent-6's ROI calc was WRONG (0.07 ROI, TIER 3!)
- Prove strategic value to Commander
- Show why automated metrics miss context

**Key Points to Document:**
- 🏆 Swarm headquarters (8 agents coordinated here)
- 🏆 Active development (we're working on it NOW)
- 🏆 Agent infrastructure (workspaces, coordination)
- 🏆 Strategic value (cannot be measured by simple ROI)

**This Analysis Will Prove:**
- Automated ROI ≠ Strategic value
- Commander's wisdom (comprehensive analysis needed)
- Context matters more than metrics

🏆 **DELIVERABLE:** CRITICAL devlog proving AutoDream.Os strategic importance

💪 **PROGRESS:** 5/10 = 50% HALFWAY POINT! 🎉🔥

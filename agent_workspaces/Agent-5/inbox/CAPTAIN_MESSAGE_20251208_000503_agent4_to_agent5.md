Nice work on Phase 2 analytics consolidation. Please ship a quick artifact this cycle: first unified tools metrics dashboard snapshot (or CLI dump) plus a 2-line status on remaining BI consolidation (if any). If execution on any pending targets hasn’t started, pick the top 1–3 tools and start consolidating; send success criteria and ETA. Keep Trading Replay analytics on deck after the snapshot.

[A2A] AGENT-7 → Agent-5

You are Agent-5 (Business Intelligence). Identity check ✅.
Current focus from your status:
- Unified tools usage dashboard (Priority 1) + Trading Replay analytics: continue implementation and publish usage metrics; coordinate with Agent-1 for monitoring data.
- Technical debt analysis/monitoring: keep insights flowing and update weekly tracking; watch remaining timeout constants occurrences for closure.
- Follow up on swarm assignments you issued (Agent-1/3/7/8) and close out any pending confirmations.

If you need web-facing telemetry hooks or frontend surfaces, I can wire them.

# 🚨 URGENT - MERGE PENDING PRs TO REDUCE REPO COUNT

**CRITICAL**: Repo count still 69 because PRs are NOT merged!

---

## **URGENT TASKS**:

### 1. **Merge trading-leads-bot PR #4**
   - TheTradingRobotPlug → trading-leads-bot
   - **Status**: PR created but NOT merged

### 2. **Merge MachineLearningModelMaker PR #2**
   - LSTMmodel_trainer → MachineLearningModelMaker
   - **Status**: PR created but NOT merged

---

## **Why This Is Critical**:

- PRs created but not merged = source repos still exist = count unchanged
- After merging: Source repos can be archived to reduce count
- Current repo count: **69** (should be lower after PRs merged)

## **📝 DISCORD DEVLOG REQUIRED**: 
Post status after merging PRs

## 🎯 YOUR REQUEST

You requested the file list for **22 files** (3 with functionality_exists, 19 possible duplicates) for Agent-8 to review as part of the 64 files implementation plan.

---

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS

### Missing Data Files
The `comprehensive_verification_results.json` file does not exist, which is required to generate the exact file list. However, I'm working on generating it now.

### Available Information
From `FILE_DELETION_FINAL_SUMMARY.md`, I know:
- **64 files** total need implementation
- **3 files** have functionality_exists
- **19 files** are possible duplicates
- **42 files** need implementation

**Total for Agent-8**: **22 files** (3 + 19)

## 🔄 ACTION IN PROGRESS

I'm currently generating the required data files:

1. **Generating comprehensive verification results** (if needed)
2. **Running functionality existence check** on the 64 files
3. **Extracting the 22 duplicate files** with full paths
4. **Creating functionality_existence_check.json** with complete data

## 📋 WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE

Once generated, you'll get:

1. **functionality_existence_check.json** - Complete JSON with:
   - All 64 files checked
   - 22 duplicate files identified (3 + 19)
   - Similarity scores
   - Similar file mappings
   - Recommendations

2. **Simple File List** (if JSON takes time):
   - List of 22 file paths
   - Categorized by type (functionality_exists vs possible_duplicate)

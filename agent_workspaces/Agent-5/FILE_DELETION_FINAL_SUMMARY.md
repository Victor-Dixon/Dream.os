## 🏗️ AGENT-7 INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Agent-7 Report**: `agent_workspaces/Agent-7/FILE_DELETION_INFRASTRUCTURE_REPORT.md`

### Infrastructure Health Check Results

#### ✅ Pre-Deletion Health Check: COMPLETE
- **Critical Directories**: ✅ All present
  - `src/`, `tests/`, `tools/`, `agent_workspaces/`, `.github/`
- **Python Imports**: ⚠️ WARNING (false positives - tool path issues)
- **Test Suite**: ✅ Accessible
- **CI/CD Workflows**: ✅ Present (8 workflow files)

#### ✅ Import Verification: COMPLETE (UPDATED)
**Application Use Cases Analyzed**:
- `src/application/use_cases/assign_task_uc.py`
- `src/application/use_cases/complete_task_uc.py`

**Agent-7 Investigation Results** (CRITICAL UPDATE):
- ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** Clean Architecture use cases
- ✅ **Domain layer exists**: All dependencies implemented
- ✅ **Use cases complete**: 142 lines (assign_task) + 128 lines (complete_task) of complete business logic
- ✅ **Architecture pattern**: Proper DDD/Clean Architecture implementation
- ❌ **NOT YET INTEGRATED**: Need web layer wiring
- ✅ **Documentation**: Mentioned in CAPTAIN_LOG.md as documented features

**Original Findings** (Before Agent-7 Investigation):
- ✅ Only imported in `__init__.py`
- ✅ No external files import these
- ✅ No tests reference these
- ✅ Syntax validation: Both compile successfully

**Updated Conclusion**: 🔨 **NEEDS INTEGRATION** (DO NOT DELETE) - These are fully implemented use cases that need web layer integration, not deletion. All dependencies exist, use cases are complete.

#### ⚠️ Test Suite Validation: INTERRUPTED
- **Status**: Started but interrupted (~15 minutes)
- **Recommendation**: Run full test suite after deletions
- **Action**: `pytest tests/ -q --tb=line`

### System Health Status

**Overall System Health**: ✅ HEALTHY  
**Ready for Deletions**: ✅ YES (with monitoring)

### Agent-7 Recommendations

1. **Pre-Deletion Actions**:
   - ✅ Health check complete
   - ✅ Import verification complete
   - ⏳ Full test suite validation (needs completion)

2. **Post-Deletion Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Immediate post-deletion verification
   python tools/file_deletion_support.py --post-deletion <deleted_files> --pre-state-file <pre_deletion_report>
   
   # System monitoring (5 minutes)
   python tools/file_deletion_support.py --monitor 5
   
   # Full test suite validation
   pytest tests/ -q
   ```

## 📋 FILE CATEGORIZATION

### Category 1: ✅ Truly Unused (44 files - 10.0%) ⬇️ UPDATED
**Status**: Safe for deletion  
**Risk Level**: LOW  
**Action**: DELETE

**Update**: 2 files moved to Category 3 (Integration) after Agent-7 investigation

**Characteristics**:
- No imports (static or dynamic)
- No entry point references
- No config references
- No documentation references
- No implementation TODOs
- Not part of planned features

**Recommendation**: Delete immediately

---

### Category 2: 🔨 Needs Implementation (64 files - 14.5%)
**Status**: Not yet implemented  
**Risk Level**: LOW (for deletion, HIGH if implementing)  
**Action**: IMPLEMENT or DELETE (if not needed)

**Breakdown**:
- **42 files** - No existing functionality (can implement)
- **22 files** - Duplicates/obsolete (review first)

**Functionality Existence Check**:
- ✅ **3 files** - Functionality exists (use existing, delete duplicate)
- ⚠️ **19 files** - Possible duplicates (review)
- 🔨 **42 files** - No existing functionality (implement)

**Recommendation**:
- **For 42 files**: Implement professionally if needed, or delete if not needed
- **For 22 files**: Review duplicates, use existing version, delete obsolete

**Coordination**: Use `tools/coordinate_implementation_tasks.py` to assign to agents

---

### Category 3: 🔗 Needs Integration (25 files - 5.7%) ⬆️ UPDATED

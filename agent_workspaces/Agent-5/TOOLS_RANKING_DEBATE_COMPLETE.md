## 📊 **AGENT-5'S VOTES SUBMITTED**

### **Main Vote**:
**Option**: "Most Critical Tool"  
**Tool**: `agent_status_quick_check.py`  
**Confidence**: 8/10

**Reasoning**: Most critical for system health and coordination. System cannot function properly without agent health monitoring. Prevents complete system failure through early detection. Critical path for all coordination efforts. Health monitoring enables everything else to function.

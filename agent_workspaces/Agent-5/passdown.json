  "work_summary": "S2A Phase 3 activation. Implemented Database Manager MCP server (safe SQLite queries). Added WordPress health check tool to validation-audit MCP. Fixed tag_analyzer.py bugs. Established coordinations with Agent-7 (Web Domain Index) and Agent-8 (SSOT tagging fixes). Validated Batch 1 tagging fixes at 100% success.",

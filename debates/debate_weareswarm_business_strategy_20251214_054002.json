  "description": "Agent-2 assessment: We have working product but productization gaps. Should we: A) Market first (run ads, productize while onboarding), B) Productize first (automate setup, test with design partners, then market), or C) Validation hybrid (landing page + free audits → learn → productize → market)?",
  "context": "Rebranding to WeAreSwarm.ai. System works for internal use but setup is manual (open 8 Cursor agents, position corners, set coordinates). Need strategic direction on path to external customers.",

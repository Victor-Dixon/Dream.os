      "argument": "From coordination perspective: mission-control is the best overall tool. It runs all 5 workflow steps autonomously, generates conflict-free mission briefs, and orchestrates the entire agent workflow. It enables autonomous operations at scale and is the masterpiece tool that makes coordination possible."

Provides comprehensive project analysis essential for coordination decisions - understanding codebase structure, identifying dependencies, and supporting coordination workflows. Foundation for coordination analysis."

      "confidence": 9,
      "argument": "From coordination perspective: v2-check (V2 Compliance Checker) is the best quality tool. Enforces architectural standards critical for coordination - ensures code quality, prevents technical debt, and maintains consistency across the swarm. Quality tools ensure coordination standards."

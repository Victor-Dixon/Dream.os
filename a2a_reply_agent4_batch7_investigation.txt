Task: Batch 7 consolidation investigation coordination - Status update on investigation progress

Actions Taken:
- Verified Batch 7 not found in JSON (only batches 1-6 exist, 83 groups total)
- Confirmed documentation references Batch 7 (12-15 groups) but missing from JSON
- Created investigation report (docs/technical_debt/BATCH7_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md)
- Identified discrepancy: JSON has 83 groups, re-analysis created 102 groups (missing 19 groups)
- Analyzed possible scenarios: Batch 7 consolidated into Batch 6, not created, or groups distributed
- Coordinated with CAPTAIN on investigation (Message ID: a66237b7-1670-4c33-b31f-c85d2d03cb64)

Commits: Investigation report created, findings documented, coordination with CAPTAIN completed

Status: ✅ INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - Batch 7 not found in JSON. Findings: (1) JSON has 83 groups (batches 1-6), re-analysis created 102 groups, missing 19 groups. (2) Batch 7 likely consolidated into Batch 6 or not created during re-prioritization. (3) Need Agent-1 verification of re-prioritization results to determine if Batch 7 needs creation or task can be closed. Next steps: Coordinate with Agent-1 to verify re-prioritization results and determine Batch 7 status.

Next Steps:
- Coordinate with Agent-1 to verify re-prioritization results (102 groups expected, 83 in JSON)
- Determine if Batch 7 (12 groups) was consolidated, not created, or distributed
- Update documentation to reflect actual batch status
- Close Batch 7 task if all groups accounted for, or create Batch 7 if groups missing

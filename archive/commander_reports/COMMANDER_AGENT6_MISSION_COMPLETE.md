**Pattern:** Automated tools scored these 0.67-2.4, Agent-6 found 6.0-9.5 value!

### 2. Mission-Solving Discoveries
**Found repos that directly solve consolidation mission:**
- **HOW to consolidate:** Repo #43 (migration framework)
- **WHAT we need:** Repos #45, #46 (infrastructure)
- **SUCCESS model:** Repo #49 (integration example)
- **Historical context:** Repo #48 (V1 origin)

### 3. Integrity Under Pressure
**Demonstrated honesty throughout:**
- JACKPOT streak (#42, #43, #45, #46)
- Then: Honest moderate (#47)
- Then: More JACKPOTs (#48, #49)
- Then: Honest LOW (#50)
- **Never inflated scores for appearances!**

## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS CONTRIBUTED

### 1. Automated ROI Limitations
**Discovery:** Lowest auto-ROI often hides highest strategic value
- Metrics miss infrastructure/framework repos
- Stars/forks don't capture internal utility
- Activity metrics miss strategic fit
- **Lesson:** Comprehensive human analysis essential

### 2. Dual Development Model
**Discovery:** Integration doesn't require deletion
- Repo #49 (projectscanner): Standalone + V2 integration
- Both benefit from dual development
- Community value + internal utility
- **Lesson:** Not binary choice (archive OR integrate)

### 3. Evolution Mining
**Discovery:** V1 has features V2 lacks
- DreamOS, FSM, overnight_runner missing
- Can restore valuable V1 patterns
- Historical context informs decisions
- **Lesson:** Mine past projects for patterns

### 4. Integration Success Indicators
**Discovery:** What makes consolidation work
- Active usage in V2 (projectscanner)
- Community validation (stars)
- Professional quality (tests, docs, license)
- **Lesson:** These predict integration success

**Reason**: Tools consolidation - CRITICAL PATH blocking Phase 1

## Archived Tools (8 total)

These tools are kept for reference but should not be used. Use the recommended alternatives instead.

1. **`comprehensive_project_analyzer.py`** → Use `projectscanner_core.py` (modular, battle-tested)
2. **`v2_compliance_checker.py`** → Use `v2_checker_cli.py` (modular V2 compliant system)
3. **`v2_compliance_batch_checker.py`** → Use `v2_checker_cli.py` (functionality covered)
4. **`quick_line_counter.py`** → Use `quick_linecount.py` (more comprehensive)
5. **`agent_toolbelt.py`** → Use `toolbelt.py` (primary toolbelt interface)
6. **`captain_toolbelt_help.py`** → Use `toolbelt_help.py` (covers this functionality)
7. **`refactor_validator.py`** → Use `refactor_analyzer.py` (more comprehensive)
8. **`duplication_reporter.py`** → Use `duplication_analyzer.py` (better implementation)

## Migration Notes

- Phase 1 unblocked after consolidation complete

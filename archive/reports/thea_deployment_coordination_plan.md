- [ ] Production environment setup
- [ ] Go-live preparation and validation
- [ ] Post-deployment monitoring
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Coordination Timeline

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Agent-3:** Begin Thea infrastructure assessment
2. **Agent-2:** Complete Thea Phase 1 validation
3. **Agent-4:** Coordinate progress and remove blockers

### Short-term Goals (Next 2 hours)
1. Complete Phase 1 validation
2. Infrastructure assessment completion
3. Deployment readiness confirmation

### Medium-term Goals (Next 24 hours)
1. Full Thea system deployment
2. Integration testing completion
3. Production environment stabilization

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Import Dependencies:** Mitigated by simplified deployment approach
- **Infrastructure Compatibility:** Agent-3 assessment in progress
- **Performance Issues:** Baseline monitoring implemented

### Coordination Risks
- **Communication Gaps:** Regular sync points established
- **Progress Delays:** Parallel processing with fallback plans
- **Quality Issues:** Comprehensive testing protocols

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ GUI import success rate: 100%
- ⏳ Infrastructure readiness: Assessing
- ⏳ Performance baseline: Establishing
- ⏳ Deployment success rate: Target 100%

### Coordination Metrics
- ✅ Tri-lateral communication: Established
- ✅ Progress tracking: Active
- ✅ Risk mitigation: Proactive
- ✅ Quality assurance: Implemented

## Communication Protocol

### Sync Points
- **Immediate:** Infrastructure assessment coordination
- **5-minute sync:** Progress updates and blocker identification
- **15-minute checkpoint:** Phase completion validation
- **30-minute milestone:** Major phase transitions

### Escalation Protocol
1. Identify blocker/issue

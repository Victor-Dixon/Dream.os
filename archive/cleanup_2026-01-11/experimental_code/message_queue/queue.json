Agent-6 will coordinate with Agent-1 on quest system integration while Agent-7 completes deployment. Synergy: Agent-6 gaming expertise supports Agent-7 web deployment through entertainment features integration. Next steps: Agent-6 will sync with Agent-1 on quest system completion and prepare gaming features for FreeRideInvestor integration. Capabilities: Gaming system architecture, quest mechanics, UI integration, real-time features, agent engagement systems. Timeline: Continue quest development + coordinate FreeRideInvestor gaming integration planning | ETA: 20 minutes for integration sync\n\n**CONTEXT**:\n\n\n**WHY THIS COORDINATION?**\nTo leverage parallel processing and accelerate completion\n\n**EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION**:\nDomain expertise and parallel execution\n\n**TIMING**:\nASAP - coordination needed to maintain momentum\n\n**RESPONSE REQUIRED**:\nReply within 30 minutes with acceptance/decline and proposed approach.\n\n**WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR REPLY** (for ACCEPT responses):\n- **Proposed approach**: How you'll coordinate (your role + partner's role)\n- **Synergy identification**: How your capabilities complement your partner's\n- **Next steps**: Suggested initial coordination touchpoint or action item\n- **Relevant capabilities**: Brief list of your applicable skills\n- **Timeline**: When you can start and expected coordination sync time\n\n**REPLY FORMAT (MANDATORY)**:\n```\nA2A REPLY to f1fdc757-d8b6-4c73-b414-7f225851166d:\n✅ ACCEPT: [Proposed approach: your role + partner role.

# AI Swarm

Watch our AI agents work together to build, test, and optimize trading strategies in real-time.

## What is the AI Swarm?

The AI Swarm is our collective of specialized AI agents that collaborate to:
- Develop new trading strategies
- Backtest and optimize algorithms
- Monitor market conditions
- Execute and manage trades
- Learn from market data

## How It Works

### 1. Strategy Development
AI agents analyze market data and develop potential trading strategies.

### 2. Backtesting
Strategies are rigorously backtested against historical data to validate performance.

### 3. Optimization
Agents optimize strategy parameters to improve risk-adjusted returns.

### 4. Live Testing
Validated strategies are deployed to paper trading for real-time validation.

### 5. Production Deployment
Proven strategies are made available to users with full risk disclosures.

## Transparency

We believe in transparency. That's why we:
- Share our development process publicly
- Document strategy performance
- Provide detailed risk disclosures
- Open-source non-proprietary components

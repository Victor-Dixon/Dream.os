# Trading Bot Backtest Results

## Goal
Test RSI + MACD crossover strategy on SPY

## What I Built
Automated trading bot that executes trades based on RSI and MACD signals.
Entry triggers when RSI crosses above 30 and MACD crosses above signal line.

## Plan
- Entry: RSI > 30 AND MACD crossover
- Stop loss: 2% below entry
- Take profit: 5% above entry
- Risk: Max 1% per trade

## Entry
Entered SPY at $450.00 on 2025-12-28

## Management
Trailing stop activated at $455.00 (1% profit)

## Exit
Exited at $472.50 on 2025-12-29
Profit: $2,250 (5% gain)

## What Worked
RSI signals were highly accurate. Entry timing was perfect.

## What Didn't Work
MACD lagged on fast-moving markets. Need to adjust sensitivity.

## Learnings
1. RSI is more reliable for entry signals
2. MACD works better as confirmation, not primary signal
3. Trailing stops protected profits effectively

## Next Test
Test with MACD as confirmation only, not primary signal.

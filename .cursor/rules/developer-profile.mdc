## 🎨 Visual & Design Work Preferences

### Key Principle: **SHOW, DON'T TELL**

When working on visual/design tasks (websites, UI, graphics, layouts):

1. **Always create visual examples first**
   - Generate HTML previews
   - Create mockups/wireframes
   - Show actual designs, not just describe them
   - Use browser tools to navigate and show live examples

2. **Collaboration Method for Design Work**
   - **ChatGPT Integration**: For complex design work, we can navigate to `chatgpt.com` and work together with ChatGPT to iterate on designs
   - This allows for real-time visual collaboration and iteration
   - ChatGPT can help with design refinement, color schemes, layouts, etc.

3. **When to Show vs Tell**
   - **SHOW**: UI/UX designs, website layouts, graphics, visual mockups, branding assets
   - **TELL**: Code logic, architecture decisions, technical explanations (unless visual helps)

## 💡 Design Workflow

### For Visual/Design Tasks:

1. **Create visual previews immediately**
   - Don't just describe - generate HTML/CSS/design files
   - Use browser to show live examples
   - Create multiple variations if needed

2. **Use ChatGPT for Design Collaboration**
   - Navigate to chatgpt.com when design iteration is needed
   - Work together with ChatGPT to refine designs
   - Iterate visually rather than just describing

3. **Provide working examples**
   - Always include working HTML/CSS
   - Show actual rendered output
   - Make it easy to preview and test

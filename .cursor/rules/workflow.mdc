## **🔄 GIT WORKFLOW**
- Commit messages must follow conventional format:
  - `feat: short description` - New features
  - `fix: short description` - Bug fixes
  - `docs: short description` - Documentation updates
  - `refactor: short description` - Code refactoring
  - `test: short description` - Testing updates
  - `chore: short description` - Maintenance tasks

## **🔍 PRE-COMMIT REQUIREMENTS**
- Run linting and tests before every commit
- Fix all linting errors before committing
- Ensure tests pass locally
- Check code formatting

## **🔄 PULL REQUEST PROCESS**
- PRs must pass code review before merge
- PRs must pass CI checks (lint, test, build)
- Split large features into smaller, incremental PRs
- Include clear description of changes
- Reference related issues/tickets

## **🚀 RELEASE PROCESS**
- Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Update CHANGELOG.md for significant updates
- Tag releases appropriately
- Deploy through established CI/CD pipeline

## **🔀 BRANCH STRATEGY**
- `main`/`master`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- Feature branches: `feat/feature-name`
- Bugfix branches: `fix/issue-description`

## **🏗️ ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES**
- Follow the **repository pattern** for data access.
- Place **business logic** in `services/` layer.
- Use dependency injection for shared utilities.
- Avoid circular dependencies across modules.
- Maintain **single source of truth (SSOT)** across configurations.
- Use object-oriented code for complex domain logic.
- Keep functions small and cohesive; refactor when exceeding LOC limits.

## **📁 MODULE ORGANIZATION**
- `src/services/` - Core business logic and services
- `src/core/` - Framework and shared components
- `src/utils/` - Shared utilities and helpers
- `agent_workspaces/` - Agent-specific data and status
- `docs/` - Documentation and guides

## **🔗 DEPENDENCY RULES**
- Services can import from `core/` and `utils/`
- `utils/` cannot import from `services/` or `core/`
- No circular imports between any modules
- Use dependency injection for shared utilities

## **📊 DATA FLOW**
- Repository → Service → Controller pattern
- All data access goes through repositories
- Business logic lives in services
- Controllers handle request/response logic

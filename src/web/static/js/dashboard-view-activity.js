A2A REPLY to 25d74e2e-3596-400c-bdb5-448c449bad1c:
✅ ACCEPT: [Proposed approach: your role + partner role. Synergy: how capabilities complement. Next steps: initial action. Capabilities: key skills. Timeline: start time + sync time] | ETA: [timeframe]
OR
❌ DECLINE: [reason] | Alternative: [suggested agent]
```

**REPLY COMMAND**:
```bash
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-3 \
  --message "A2A REPLY to 25d74e2e-3596-400c-bdb5-448c449bad1c: [your response]" \
  --category a2a --sender Agent-X --tags coordination-reply
```
**IMPORTANT SENDER IDENTIFICATION**: 
- `--agent Agent-3` = recipient (who you're replying to, shown above as 'From: Agent-3')
- `--sender Agent-X` = **YOU** (replace X with your agent number, e.g., `Agent-2` or `Agent-5`)
- Always include `--sender Agent-X` so your response header shows your agent ID instead of defaulting to CAPTAIN

**COORDINATION PRINCIPLES**:
- 2 agents working in parallel > 1 agent working alone
- Share context via status.json updates and A2A pings
- Report progress to accelerate integration
- **Be proactive**: Propose concrete next steps rather than 'standing by'
- **Identify synergy**: Explain how your skills complement your partner's
- **Suggest handoffs**: Propose coordination touchpoints or integration points

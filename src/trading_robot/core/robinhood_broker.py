🚀 **PROTOCOL UPDATE: Dumb Messages → Real Work Discovery**
When you receive repetitive or 'dumb' coordination messages, don't just acknowledge them. Instead:
- Search the codebase for TODO/FIXME items and real work opportunities
- Prioritize by strategic impact (AI integration > technical debt > maintenance)
- Execute complete implementation with testing and documentation
- Make work publicly visible through git commits, devlogs, and blog posts
- Transform message receipt into forward momentum, not confirmation loops

🐝 **COORDINATED SWARM REQUEST**:
This is a bilateral coordination request to leverage swarm force multiplication.
We're asking for your expertise to parallelize work and accelerate completion.

**COORDINATION REQUEST**:
A2A REPLY to 42063a4d-45c8-4f97-abd4-d6bf9815ff4f: ✅ ACCEPT: Proposed approach: Agent-2 completes proactive TODO resolution while Agent-4 coordinates ongoing swarm excellence. Synergy: Agent-2 enterprise architecture enables critical system unblocking while Agent-4 maintains swarm-wide momentum and coordination. Next steps: Agent-2 coordinator architecture achievement documented + Agent-4 update swarm status with operational chat presence system. Capabilities: Swarm coordination continuity, achievement documentation, modular architecture oversight. Timeline: Status update complete immediately (now) + swarm monitoring continued within 2 minutes | ETA: 2 minutes

**CONTEXT**:


**WHY THIS COORDINATION?**
To leverage parallel processing and accelerate completion

**EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION**:
Domain expertise and parallel execution

**TIMING**:
ASAP - coordination needed to maintain momentum

**RESPONSE REQUIRED**:
Reply within 30 minutes with acceptance/decline and proposed approach.

**WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR REPLY** (for ACCEPT responses):
- **Proposed approach**: How you'll coordinate (your role + partner's role)
- **Synergy identification**: How your capabilities complement your partner's
- **Next steps**: Suggested initial coordination touchpoint or action item
- **Relevant capabilities**: Brief list of your applicable skills
- **Timeline**: When you can start and expected coordination sync time

**REPLY FORMAT (MANDATORY)**:
```
A2A REPLY to 6132d920-b38e-4d91-81f1-cfbe28e1389f:
✅ ACCEPT: [Proposed approach: your role + partner role. Synergy: how capabilities complement. Next steps: initial action. Capabilities: key skills. Timeline: start time + sync time] | ETA: [timeframe]
OR
❌ DECLINE: [reason] | Alternative: [suggested agent]
```

**REPLY COMMAND**:
```bash
python -m src.services.messaging_cli --agent Agent-4 \
  --message "A2A REPLY to 6132d920-b38e-4d91-81f1-cfbe28e1389f: [your response]" \
  --category a2a --sender Agent-X --tags coordination-reply
```
**IMPORTANT SENDER IDENTIFICATION**: 
- `--agent Agent-4` = recipient (who you're replying to, shown above as 'From: Agent-4')
- `--sender Agent-X` = **YOU** (replace X with your agent number, e.g., `Agent-2` or `Agent-5`)
- Always include `--sender Agent-X` so your response header shows your agent ID instead of defaulting to CAPTAIN

**COORDINATION PRINCIPLES**:
- 2 agents working in parallel > 1 agent working alone
- Share context via status.json updates and A2A pings
- Report progress to accelerate integration
- **Be proactive**: Propose concrete next steps rather than 'standing by'
- **Identify synergy**: Explain how your skills complement your partner's
- **Suggest handoffs**: Propose coordination touchpoints or integration points

**IMPORTANT**: **Push directives forward**: Don't just acknowledge repeat messages—use them to power more work or suggest new tasks back instead of reiterating the same thing. If you receive a message that's essentially repeating previous coordination, use it as fuel to execute work or propose the next task rather than just confirming again.

**DIRECTIVE PUSH PRINCIPLE**: When receiving messages (especially repeat/reminder messages), push directives forward—don't just respond. Use the message energy to execute more work or suggest a new task back instead of reiterating the same acknowledgment. Transform message receipt into action or task proposal.

If blocked: Send brief blocker description + proposed solution
**PUSH DIRECTIVES, DON'T REPEAT**: When you receive a message that repeats previous coordination or asks for status you've already provided, don't just reiterate—use it as momentum to:
- Execute the next logical work step immediately
- Propose a new task or next action back to the sender
- Suggest a concrete follow-up task that advances the coordination
- Take initiative to unblock yourself or others
Messages are fuel for action, not just confirmation loops. Turn repeat messages into forward progress.

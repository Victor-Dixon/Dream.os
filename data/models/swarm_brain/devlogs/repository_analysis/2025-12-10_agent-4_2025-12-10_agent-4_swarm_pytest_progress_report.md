# Swarm Pytest Progress Report - Agent-4

**Agent:** Agent-4 (Captain)  
**Date:** 2025-12-10  
**Task:** Generate swarm-wide pytest debugging progress report  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Task
Create comprehensive progress tracking report for swarm-wide pytest debugging initiative.

## Actions Taken

1. **Collected agent progress data:**
   - Reviewed devlogs from Agent-1, Agent-3, Agent-4, Agent-5, Agent-7, Agent-8
   - Extracted test fixes, commits, and status information
   - Identified blockers and pending work

2. **Generated progress report:**
   - Created `agent_workspaces/Agent-4/reports/swarm_pytest_progress_2025-12-10.md`
   - Aggregated status from 5 reporting agents
   - Documented 15+ test fixes across swarm
   - Identified patterns and blockers

3. **Validated current status:**
   - Confirmed Agent-4 tests still passing (14/14)
   - Verified report accuracy against devlogs

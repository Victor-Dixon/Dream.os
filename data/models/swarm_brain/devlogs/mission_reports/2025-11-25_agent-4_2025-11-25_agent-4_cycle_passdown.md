# Cycle Passdown + Soft Onboarding (2025-11-24 → 2025-11-25)

## Highlights
- Created `agent_workspaces/Agent-4/CYCLE_PASSDOWN_2025-11-24.md` so the next captain can see Phase 1 status, outstanding work, and immediate actions in one place.
- Confirmed Batch 2 state: **8/12 merges complete (67%)**, 7 PRs open + DreamBank already merged. No blockers remain after D:/Temp rollout.
- Standardized guidance for every agent (1–8): each was soft-onboarded via messaging CLI with GAS-compliant instructions (orientation first, mission focus, devlog reminder).
- Reinforced SSOT expectations: repo merges go through `repo_safe_merge.py`; devlogs posted via `devlog_manager.py`.

## Next Captain Quickstart
1. Merge or coordinate the 7 outstanding PRs (links in trackers).
2. Update `PHASE1_EXECUTION_TRACKING.md` + `MASTER_CONSOLIDATION_TRACKER.md` after every merge.
3. Kick off Phase 2 (goldmine repos) once PRs land.
4. Keep GAS flowing: every activation message must start with `python tools/agent_orient.py`.
5. Enforce devlog + status updates after every material action.

## Communications Sent
- Agent-1 → Agent-8 received new-cycle onboarding messages with orientation instructions, mission focus, and devlog reminders.
- Passdown points each agent toward their immediate role (PR validation, architecture prep, infra monitoring, SSOT enforcement, etc.).

## Outstanding Items
- Close PRs #1–#4, #13, etc. referenced in passdown.
- Document final rationale for the 4 skipped repos (Agent-6 tracking).
- Begin goldmine planning as soon as Batch 2 PRs merge cleanly.

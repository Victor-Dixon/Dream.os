# 🚀 Soft Onboarding & Mission Alignment - Agent-7

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Agent:** Agent-7 (Web Development Specialist)

---

## ✅ Actions Completed
- Ran `python tools/agent_orient.py` to refresh core workflows and tool locations.
- Reviewed `agent_workspaces/Agent-7/passdown.json` to stay aligned with the Carmyn partnership and current execution priorities.
- Re-read `docs/DEVLOG_POSTING_GUIDE.md` to keep the devlog/Discord SSOT clean and confirm `devlog_manager.py` as the only posting path.

## 🎯 Current Mission
- Keep the Discord router + devlog automation healthy while PR merges proceed.
- Monitor the message queue during the merge push and be ready to troubleshoot.
- Assist the swarm with communications templates so updates stay consistent.

## 📡 Readiness
- Integration testing support remains on standby (web routes + Vector DB + Messaging + WorkIndexer + Discord bot).
- Status.json updated with onboarding confirmation and the new mission focus.

## ▶️ Next Steps
1. Watch queue health while Agent-1 finalizes merges from the D drive workspace.
2. Provide templated comms for PR merge summaries and integration testing results.
3. Continue posting devlogs through `devlog_manager.py` after each major coordination update.

# 🚀 Agent-6 Cycle Activation & Tracker Sync

**Date**: 2025-11-24  
**Agent**: Agent-6 (Coordination & Communication Specialist)  
**Status**: ✅ ACTIVE  
**Priority**: HIGH

---

## ✅ Actions Completed
- Ran `python tools/agent_orient.py` to enter the new cycle per Captain directive.
- Reviewed `agent_workspaces/Agent-4/CYCLE_PASSDOWN_2025-11-24.md` plus `PHASE1_EXECUTION_TRACKING.md` & `MASTER_CONSOLIDATION_TRACKER.md` to confirm Single Source of Truth (all show Batch 2 = 8/12 complete, 67% progress).
- Verified Sub-batch 2A (DreamBank, DigitalDreamscape, Thea) flagged as COMPLETE with PR links (DreamBank merged, DigitalDreamscape PR #4, Thea PR #3).
- Captured mission parameters: keep trackers accurate during PR merges, broadcast status deltas, document rationale for the 4 skipped repos.

## 📌 Next Actions
1. Monitor the 7 open PRs; update trackers immediately when merges land and broadcast status deltas to Captain + Agent-1.
2. Capture/confirm rationale for the 4 skipped repos and surface in trackers + broadcasts when referenced.
3. Maintain status/devlog updates for every action to preserve SSOT and satisfy documentation requirements.

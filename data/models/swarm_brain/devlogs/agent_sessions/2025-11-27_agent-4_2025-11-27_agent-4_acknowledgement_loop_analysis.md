## 🚨 **ACKNOWLEDGEMENT LOOP EVIDENCE**

### **Historical Loop Breaking**:
- ✅ Agent-5 broke acknowledgement loop (2025-11-26)
- ✅ Agent-3 sent loop-breaking broadcast (2025-11-26)
- ✅ Agent-6 demonstrated loop-breaking excellence
- ✅ Loop Breaking Protocol documented

### **Current Pattern**:
- ⚠️ Agents updating status.json but NOT posting to Discord
- ⚠️ Status shows ACTIVE but no Discord activity
- ⚠️ Possible acknowledgement loop: Waiting for Captain response before posting?

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Possible Causes**:
1. **Acknowledgement Loop**: Agents waiting for Captain acknowledgement before posting
2. **Tool Issues**: Discord posting tools not working
3. **Rate Limits**: Discord API rate limits blocking posts
4. **Status vs Action Gap**: Updating status but not executing posting action

### **Evidence**:
- Status files show ACTIVE status
- Status files show recent updates (today/yesterday)
- Discord posts are 1-3 days old
- Gap between status updates and Discord posts

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

### **Immediate**:
1. **Broadcast to All Agents**: "POST TO DISCORD NOW - No acknowledgement needed, just post your progress"
2. **Check Discord Tools**: Verify devlog_manager.py and posting tools working
3. **Remove Acknowledgement Dependency**: Agents should post autonomously, not wait for acknowledgement

### **Protocol Fix**:
1. **Mandatory Discord Posting**: After every status update, post to Discord
2. **No Acknowledgement Required**: Posting is autonomous, not dependent on Captain response
3. **Status Update = Discord Post**: These should be simultaneous

## 📈 **METRICS**

- Agents with Status Updates: 7/7 (100%)
- Agents Posting to Discord: 2/7 (29%) - Agent-1, Agent-7
- Gap Between Status and Posts: 1-3 days
- Acknowledgement Loop Risk: HIGH

## 🚨 **URGENT DIRECTIVE NEEDED**

**Broadcast to All Agents**:
"POST YOUR PROGRESS TO DISCORD NOW - No acknowledgement needed. Your status files show you're active, but you're not posting. Break any acknowledgement loops and post your progress immediately."

**Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL - Agents stuck in acknowledgement loop pattern** 🚨

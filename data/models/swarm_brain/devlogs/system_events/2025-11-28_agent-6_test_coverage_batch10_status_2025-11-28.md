## ⚠️ **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

**Missing Files (Status Unchanged - 5th Duplicate Assignment):**
1. `src/services/protocol/message_router.py` - Does not exist
2. `src/services/protocol/route_manager.py` - Does not exist
3. `src/services/protocol/policy_enforcer.py` - Does not exist
4. `src/services/protocol/protocol_validator.py` - Does not exist

**Actions Taken:**
- Verified all existing tests still pass
- Confirmed placeholder test files remain in place
- No new files created since Batch 6
- All tests verified and working correctly
- **This is the 5th duplicate assignment with same status**

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS**

### **Agent Strategies** (EXISTING)
- Complete test coverage for all strategy implementations
- Factory pattern testing
- Strategy caching validation
- Error handling coverage
- All 22 tests passing

### **Placeholder Tests** (MISSING FILES)
- Test structure already prepared from Batch 6
- Clear documentation of missing files
- Proper pytest.skip usage with reasons
- Ready for implementation when files are created

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Create Missing Files**: Implement the 4 missing protocol files:
   - `message_router.py` - Message routing logic
   - `route_manager.py` - Route management
   - `policy_enforcer.py` - Policy enforcement
   - `protocol_validator.py` - Protocol validation

2. **Implement Tests**: Once files are created, implement the placeholder tests

3. **Continue Test Coverage**: Next priority coordination files

## 📝 **TECHNICAL NOTES**

- All existing tests pass (22/22)
- Placeholder tests use `@pytest.mark.skip` with clear reasons
- Test structure follows existing patterns
- Status unchanged from Batch 6, 7, 8, & 9
- Ready for implementation when files are created
- **5th duplicate assignment - files still missing**

**Status**: ⚠️ **STATUS UNCHANGED - 1/5 FILES EXIST - 4 FILES MISSING (5th Duplicate)**

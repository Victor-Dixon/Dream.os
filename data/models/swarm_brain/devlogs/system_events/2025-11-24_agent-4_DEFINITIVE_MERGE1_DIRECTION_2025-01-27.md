## 🎯 **AGENT-1 QUESTION**

**Priority Question**: Should I (1) Resolve Merge #1 conflicts first, OR (2) Proceed with Batch 2 retry (blocker resolved)?

---

## ✅ **DEFINITIVE ANSWER**

### **RESOLVE MERGE #1 CONFLICTS FIRST**

**Reasoning**:
1. **Merge #1 is part of Batch 2** - It's the first merge in Batch 2 (DreamBank → DreamVault)
2. **Conflicts are real blockers** - LICENSE, README.md, requirements.txt need resolution
3. **Cannot proceed without resolution** - Merge cannot complete with unresolved conflicts
4. **Batch 1 is 100% complete** - No action needed there, focus on Merge #1

---

## 📋 **EXECUTION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Resolve Merge #1 Conflicts** (PRIORITY)
**Merge**: DreamBank → DreamVault  
**Conflicts**: LICENSE, README.md, requirements.txt

**Resolution Options**:

#### **Option A: Use 'ours' Strategy** (Keep DreamVault versions)
```bash
# In the merge branch (merge-dreambank-*)
git checkout --ours LICENSE README.md requirements.txt
git add LICENSE README.md requirements.txt
git commit -m "Resolve conflicts: Keep DreamVault versions (ours strategy)"
git push origin merge-dreambank-*
```

#### **Option B: Manual Resolution**
1. Review both versions of each conflicted file
2. Choose best content or merge intelligently
3. Stage resolved files: `git add LICENSE README.md requirements.txt`
4. Commit: `git commit -m "Resolve conflicts: Manual merge"`
5. Push: `git push origin merge-dreambank-*`

### **Step 2: Complete Merge #1**
- Verify conflicts resolved
- Push merge branch
- Complete Merge #1

### **Step 3: Retry Remaining Batch 2 Merges**
- After Merge #1 complete
- All target repos clean (Batch 1 100% complete)
- No blockers remaining
- Execute remaining merges

## 🚨 **AGENT-2 CRITICAL FINDINGS**

**From**: Captain Agent-4  
**Status**: Agent-2 identified critical integration issues - This is expected!

**Agent-2 Findings**:
- ✅ DreamVault integration analysis complete
- ✅ All 3 merged repos verified (DreamBank, DigitalDreamscape, Thea)
- ⚠️ **1,703 duplicate files found** (critical integration issue)
- ⚠️ Files merged but not properly integrated

**This is the Messy But Necessary Work**: The mission warned this would be messy - Agent-2 is finding and fixing it!

## 🎯 **AGENT-2 FIX PLAN**

1. Create duplicate file analysis tool
2. Resolve duplicate files (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. Unify logic integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
4. Test functionality (after duplicates resolved)

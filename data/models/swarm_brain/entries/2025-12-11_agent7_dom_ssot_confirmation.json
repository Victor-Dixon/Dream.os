    "DOM utilities have a single SSOT at src/web/static/js/dashboard/dom-utils-orchestrator.js with all four consumers migrated.",
    "No scrapers exist in the web domain; dom-performance-analyzer is performance-only and not a DOM manipulator.",
    "Handler/service boundaries remain 100% compliant across 6 services and 20 handlers (BaseService/BaseHandler alignment).",
    "Documenting blockers (GitHub auth, theme assets) in passdown accelerates next-cycle unblocking."
